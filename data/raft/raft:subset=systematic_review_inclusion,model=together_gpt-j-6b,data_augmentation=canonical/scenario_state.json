We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Seventy articles were analysed descriptively and substantively. Our overview of da nature, extent, and range of research published in dem articles highlights dat most studies focus on motivations fa teaching, witt intrinsic and altruistic motivations most commonly identified. We argue dat a broader range of theoretical perspectives could add fresh insights to da question of y people claim teaching.

Here we demonstrate that more subjects were willing to give assistance to unfamiliar people in need if they could make their charity offers in the presence of their group mates than in a situation where the offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willing to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores than others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that while several personality and behavior traits (cooperative ability, Machiavellianism, sensitivity to norms, and sex) play a role in the development of prosocial behavior, the possibility of gaining reputation within the group remains a measurable determinant of charitable behavior. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days.

We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A self-administered survey was used to collect data from the drivers at a large metroplex in Southwest USA. Multiple regression and scanning electron microscope procedures were used to analyze and test the proposed hypotheses. Findings \u2013 When consumers notice the increase in gas prices, they become very anxious. This anxiety is positively associated with average gas bought in gallons and negatively associated with threshold price. Further, this consumer anxiety has the strongest influence on lifestyle changes, followed by automobile technology change and transportation mode change, and has the weakest influence on gasoline brand/type change. Research limitations/implications \u2013 We focus on only anxiety as a mediator between increase in gas prices and the behavioral outcomes, and collect data from only one location. Practical implications \u2013 Managers must be cognizant that a price increase in essential goods not only influences the demand for focal products but also for products that may not seem related to the focal products. Social implications \u2013 Increase in gasoline price will not only affect the demand for gasoline, but also the demand for alternate forms of transportation, fuel efficient vehicles, and other aspects of life. Originality/value \u2013 This study is the first to look at the role of anxiety as a mediator and looks at the effects of increase in gas prices in a holistic manner. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\nJournal: J.

For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A self-administered survey was used to collect data from the drivers at a large metroplex in Southwest USA. Multiple regression and scanning electron microscope procedures were used to analyze and test the proposed hypotheses. Findings \u2013 When consumers notice the increase in gas prices, they become very anxious. This anxiety is positively associated with average gas bought in gallons and negatively associated with threshold price. Further, this consumer anxiety has the strongest influence on lifestyle changes, followed by automobile technology change and transportation mode change, and has the weakest influence on gasoline brand/type change. Research limitations/implications \u2013 We focus on only anxiety as a mediator between increase in gas prices and the behavioral outcomes, and collect data from only one location. Practical implications \u2013 Managers must be cognizant that a price increase in essential goods not only influences the demand for focal products but also for products that may not seem related to the focal products. Social implications \u2013 Increase in gasoline price will not only affect the demand for gasoline, but also the demand for alternate forms of transportation, fuel efficient vehicles, and other aspects of life. Originality/value \u2013 This study is the first to look at the role of anxiety as a mediator and looks at the effects of increase in gas prices in a holistic manner. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21).

Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A self-administered survey was used to collect data from da drivers at a bigass metroplex in Southwest USA. Multiple regression and scanning electron microscope procedures were used to analyze and test da proposed hypotheses. Findings \u2013 When consumers notice da increase in gas prices, they become very anxious. Dis anxiety is positively associated w average gas bought in gallons and negatively associated w threshold price. Further, dis consumer anxiety has da strongest influence on lifestyle changes, followed by automobile technology change and transportation mode change, and has da weakest influence on gasoline brand/type change. Research limitations/implications \u2013 We focus on only anxiety as a mediator between increase in gas prices and da behavioral outcomes, and collect data from only one location. Practical implications \u2013 Managers must b cognizant dat a price increase in essential goods not only influences da demand fa focal products but also fir products dat may not seem related to da focal products. Social implications \u2013 Increase in gasoline price gon not only affect da demand fir gasoline, but also da demand fir alternate forms of transportation, fuel efficient vehicles, and other aspects of life. Originality/value \u2013 Dis study is da first to look at da role of anxiety as a mediator and looks at da effects of increase in gas prices in a holistic manner. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\nJournal: J.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In humans, oestrogen-dependent characteristics of the female body correlate with health and reproductive fitness and are found attractive. Enhancing the sexual dimorphism of human faces should raise attractiveness by enhancing sex-hormone-related cues to youth and fertility in females, and to dominance and immunocompetence in males. Here we report the results of asking subjects to choose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced or diminished differences between the average shape of female and male faces. As predicted, subjects preferred feminized to average shapes of a female face. This preference applied across UK and Japanese populations but was stronger for within-population judgements, which indicates that attractiveness cues are learned. Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes of a male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increased both perceived dominance and negative attributions (for example, coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternal investment. These results indicate a selection pressure that limits sexual dimorphism and encourages neoteny in humans.\nJournal: Nature",

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The first (see Robert Sears) involved attempts to combine Freudian and stimulus-response learning theory. Explaining the internalization of parent expectations, however, was a challenge for this approach. In a second form, Albert Bandura employed learning principles of reinforcement and punishment but also argued that the primary form of learning was observation. Additionally, he emphasized the role of cognition in learning. A third form, associated with Gerald Patterson among others, focuses on behavior management of difficult children and continues to underlie many forms of intervention practiced today. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The first (see Robert Sears) involved attempts to combine Freudian and stimulus-response learning theory. Explaining the internalization of parent expectations, however, was a challenge for this approach. In a second form, Albert Bandura employed learning principles of reinforcement and punishment but also argued that the primary form of learning was observation. Additionally, he emphasized the role of cognition in learning. A third form, associated with Gerald Patterson among others, focuses on behavior management of difficult children and continues to underlie many forms of intervention practiced today. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Redistribution has two opposite effects on voluntary giving. The price of charitable giving decreases with the degree of redistribution, and this has a positive effect on the total amount of giving (substitution effect). However, redistribution leads to lower consumption for the contributors and therefore has a negative effect on contributions to the charity (income effect). The theoretical model developed in this paper demonstrates that, under a general class of utility functions, the substitution effect dominates the income effect. Hence, charitable giving increases with the tax rate. In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized independent of the ex-ante income inequality. However, the positive impact of taxation on charitable giving and welfare may disappear if individuals generate their income levels in anticipation of taxation and redistribution does not take into account the cost of effort. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or bigass (30) number of stickers, and were then given da opportunity to share their windfall witt either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's givin was consistent wit a proportion- based account, such dat children typically donated a similar proportion (but diff absolute number) of da resources given to em, regardless of whether they originally received a small or bigass windfall. Da proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on da number of recipients witt whom they were allowed to share, such dat on average, children shared more when dere were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when wit prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated dat a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, w/ males generally sharing more resources den females. Together, findings suggest dat the numerical contexts under which children r asked to share, as well as da quantity of resources dat they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.",

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

However, soo far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to b successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is da development of a measure of strategic ability dat borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of da likelihood of success in many social activities dat involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, dat we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, da individual obtained score depends on da distribution of choices of other decision-makers takin the test. Da test is designed to provide information on da abilities related to 2 dimensions, mentalization and rationality, dat we argue r crucial to strategic success, wit each dimension bein characterized by 2 main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows dat indeed 4 factors (2 for rationality, 2 for mentalization) account fa strategic success in most of da strategically simpler games of da test. Moreover, 2 more strategically sophisticated games r inserted in da test and r used to investigate if and to wht extent da four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, da collected empirical evidence points to da possibility of building a SQ measure usin only simple games designed to capture information bou the 4 identified factors. \u00a9 2019 Bilancini, Boncinelli and Mattiassi.\nJournal: Front.

The first technique utilizes a small antecedent request to encourage behavioral involvement and favorable disposition toward the target activity of the critical request to donate. The second approach frames the critical request as a concession following refusal of a very large request. The two techniques, dubbed the foot\u2010in\u2010the\u2010door (FID) and door\u2010in\u2010the\u2010face (DIF), respectively, were tested against a control condition on three donor groups: active donors, inactive donors, and nondonors. Thus, a three\u2010by\u2010three factorial design was used on 910 adults in a Midwest city. Although the DIF was outperformed by the control across all three donor groups, the authors recommend its continued study in face\u2010to\u2010face donor solicitation. Importantly, the FID approach produced more donations than the control condition among active donors (Z = 4.30; p < .001), inactives (Z = 7.45; p < .001), and nondonors (Z = 1.98; p < .05). For managing the blood supply, the FID is particularly potent for rekindling donations from inactive donors.

Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

XCM: The review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. The search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced the possibility of language bias. It did not appear that specific searches were undertaken for unpublished studies, so some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used for quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed using an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining the results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given the variability of the studies and the statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in the some of the meta-analyses.The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented, but given the variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) the included studies, together with poor reporting of the review process, their reliability is uncertain. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that there may be a particular training need for clinical officers in light of the increase in wound infection and dehiscence compared with doctors.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.\nJournal: ",

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

XCM: The review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. The search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced the possibility of language bias. It did not appear that specific searches were undertaken for unpublished studies, so some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used for quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed using an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining the results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given the variability of the studies and the statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in the some of the meta-analyses.The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented, but given the variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) the included studies, together with poor reporting of the review process, their reliability is uncertain. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that there may be a particular training need for clinical officers in light of the increase in wound infection and dehiscence compared with doctors.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.\nJournal: \nLabel:",

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

XCM: Da review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. Da search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced da possibility of language bias. It did not appear dat specific searches were undertaken fa unpublished studies, soo some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used fa quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed usin an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining da results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given da variability of da studies and da statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in da some of da meta-analyses.Da authors' conclusions reflect da evidence presented, but given da variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) da included studies, together w/ poor reporting of da review process, their reliability is uncertain. XIM: Practice: Da authors stated dat there may b a particular training need fir clinical officers in light of da increase in wound infection and dehiscence compared w doctors.Research: Da authors did not state any implications fir further research.\nJournal: \nLabel:",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.",

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21).

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health",

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health\nLabel:",

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

A systematic review was conducted to describe da empirical evidence bou episodic volunteering (EV) in da public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals dat identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in da health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to da health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was da most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined da economic costs of EV. Thea was lil consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helpin others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin da development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies fa the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health\nLabel:",

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Reputation by itself has been shown to have a strong influence on cooperation dynamics in games of indirect reciprocity, and this notion helps to explain the observed high level of cooperation in humans. Here we designed a game to test a widespread assumption that gossip functions as a vector for the transmission of social information. This empirical study (with 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on the composition of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and the behavior based on gossip information. We show that gossip has a strong influence on the resulting behavior even when participants have access to the original information (i.e., direct observation) as well as gossip about the same information. Thus, it is evident that gossip has a strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip about cooperative individuals is more positive than gossip about uncooperative individuals, gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation levels are higher when people encounter positive compared with negative gossip. \u00a9 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.\nJournal: Proc.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support for presumed consent, though with variation in results that may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ",

Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support for presumed consent, though with variation in results that may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ\nLabel:",

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates b4 and after da introduction of legislation fir presumed consent (b4 and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries w and w/o presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: Da five b4 and after studies represented three countries: alll reported an increase in donation rates after da introduction of presumed consent, but dere was lil investigation of any other changes takin place concurrently w/ the change in legislation. In da four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated wit increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in da four studies. Other factors found to b important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, nasty domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of da UK public. Dese surveys varied in da level of support fir presumed consent, witt surveys conducted b4 2000 reporting da lowest levels of support (28-57%). Da most recent survey, in 2007, reported dat 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain da variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of da transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may alll play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support fa presumed consent, tho with variation in results dat may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ\nLabel:",

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

The public health implications of food insecurity are significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have the potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources are adequate, provisions of perishable food groups are available, and client needs are identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.

The public health implications of food insecurity are significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have the potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources are adequate, provisions of perishable food groups are available, and client needs are identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Dis paper presents a scoping review of empirical studies, published between 2007 and 2016, dat addressed influences on da choice of teachin as a career. Seventy articles were analysed descriptively and substantively. Our overview of da nature, extent, and range of research published in dem articles highlights dat most studies focus on motivations fa teaching, witt intrinsic and altruistic motivations most commonly identified. We argue dat a broader range of theoretical perspectives could add fresh insights to da question of y people claim teaching.

Here we demonstrate that more subjects were willing to give assistance to unfamiliar people in need if they could make their charity offers in the presence of their group mates than in a situation where the offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willing to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores than others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that while several personality and behavior traits (cooperative ability, Machiavellianism, sensitivity to norms, and sex) play a role in the development of prosocial behavior, the possibility of gaining reputation within the group remains a measurable determinant of charitable behavior. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

The modules are all-inclusive, with a cross-cultural and international focus, requiring less preparation on the part of instructors and are easier for different types of students to use than existing online resources. Education and research using the site can occur at the same time, each strengthening the other in the process. Rather than simply ethical understanding or the ability to reason ethically, research on moral psychology can ensure more ethical behaviors, better understanding what people know and think about ethics and the causes of (un)ethical behaviors. This research is cross-cultural, since culture has been shown to affect behaviors and thoughts related to ethics, and the educational and working environments of engineering are more cross-cultural and international than ever before. \u00a9 American Society for Engineering Education, 2019\nJournal: ASEE Annu.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

The modules are all-inclusive, with a cross-cultural and international focus, requiring less preparation on the part of instructors and are easier for different types of students to use than existing online resources. Education and research using the site can occur at the same time, each strengthening the other in the process. Rather than simply ethical understanding or the ability to reason ethically, research on moral psychology can ensure more ethical behaviors, better understanding what people know and think about ethics and the causes of (un)ethical behaviors. This research is cross-cultural, since culture has been shown to affect behaviors and thoughts related to ethics, and the educational and working environments of engineering are more cross-cultural and international than ever before. \u00a9 American Society for Engineering Education, 2019\nJournal: ASEE Annu.

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Da modules r all-inclusive, w a cross-cultural and international focus, requiring less preparation on da part of instructors and r easier fa different types of students to use den existing online resources. Education and research usin the site can occur at da same time, each strengthening da other in da process. Rather den simply ethical understanding or da ability to reason ethically, research on moral psychology can ensure more ethical behaviors, betta understanding wat people kno and think abt ethics and da causes of (un)ethical behaviors. Dis research is cross-cultural, since culture has been shown to affect behaviors and thoughts related to ethics, and da educational and workin environments of engineering r more cross-cultural and international den ever b4. \u00a9 American Society fa Engineering Education, 2019\nJournal: ASEE Annu.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

In humans, oestrogen-dependent characteristics of the female body correlate with health and reproductive fitness and are found attractive. Enhancing the sexual dimorphism of human faces should raise attractiveness by enhancing sex-hormone-related cues to youth and fertility in females, and to dominance and immunocompetence in males. Here we report the results of asking subjects to choose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced or diminished differences between the average shape of female and male faces. As predicted, subjects preferred feminized to average shapes of a female face. This preference applied across UK and Japanese populations but was stronger for within-population judgements, which indicates that attractiveness cues are learned. Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes of a male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increased both perceived dominance and negative attributions (for example, coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternal investment. These results indicate a selection pressure that limits sexual dimorphism and encourages neoteny in humans.\nJournal: Nature",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

In a second form, Albert Bandura employed learning principles of reinforcement and punishment but also argued that the primary form of learning was observation. Additionally, he emphasized the role of cognition in learning. A third form, associated with Gerald Patterson among others, focuses on behavior management of difficult children and continues to underlie many forms of intervention practiced today. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The first (see Robert Sears) involved attempts to combine Freudian and stimulus-response learning theory. Explaining the internalization of parent expectations, however, was a challenge for this approach. In a second form, Albert Bandura employed learning principles of reinforcement and punishment but also argued that the primary form of learning was observation. Additionally, he emphasized the role of cognition in learning. A third form, associated with Gerald Patterson among others, focuses on behavior management of difficult children and continues to underlie many forms of intervention practiced today. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

Redistribution has two opposite effects on voluntary giving. The price of charitable giving decreases with the degree of redistribution, and this has a positive effect on the total amount of giving (substitution effect). However, redistribution leads to lower consumption for the contributors and therefore has a negative effect on contributions to the charity (income effect). The theoretical model developed in this paper demonstrates that, under a general class of utility functions, the substitution effect dominates the income effect. Hence, charitable giving increases with the tax rate. In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized independent of the ex-ante income inequality. However, the positive impact of taxation on charitable giving and welfare may disappear if individuals generate their income levels in anticipation of taxation and redistribution does not take into account the cost of effort. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Our study is da first such direct comparison between 2 ways in which dudes can deceive. We find dat requiring informed parties to make an explicit statement yields greater deception den when information is communicated implicitly, particularly fa larger stakes. However, allowing da explicit statement to b accompanied by a promise of truthfulness reverses dis effect. In contrast w/ many previous studies, we generally observe very high frequencies of dishonesty. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.\nJournal: J. Econ. Behav. Organ.\nLabel:",

The number of component studies in the meta-analysis, the nature of the selection mechanism, the range of variances of the effect size estimates, and the true underlying effect size are all observed to be influential in determining the power of the test. The test is fairly powerful for large meta-analyses with 75 component studies, but has only moderate power for meta-analyses with 25 component studies. However, in many of the configurations in which there is low power, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, the test must be interpreted with caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot be ruled out if the test is not significant.

RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria.

In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Da Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates dat intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both da individual and da context. Fa example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like da Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays offf because of da opportunity fir reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in da Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG givin can b long-run advantageous cause of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, da SHH predicts dat intuition gon favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG givin among women. Heaa I present meta-analytic evidence in support of dis prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find dat promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent fir both men and women. Dis stands in contrast to da results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes givin among women but not men. Furthermore, I show usin meta-regression dat the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in da DG compared to da cooperation games.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Then we propose the next steps for advancing the field\u2019s understanding of youth\u2019s prosocial behavior in the digital age. We advocate for extending existing measures to capture experiences that are increasingly relevant for children and adolescents today, with a focus on current events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and social and political activism. We also provide a research agenda to advance the understanding of prosocial development. \u00a9 2021 The Authors Child Development Perspectives \u00a9 2021 The Society for Research in Child Development\nJournal: Child Dev.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors. \u00a9 2019 Bilancini, Boncinelli and Mattiassi.\nJournal: Front.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

The first technique utilizes a small antecedent request to encourage behavioral involvement and favorable disposition toward the target activity of the critical request to donate. The second approach frames the critical request as a concession following refusal of a very large request. The two techniques, dubbed the foot\u2010in\u2010the\u2010door (FID) and door\u2010in\u2010the\u2010face (DIF), respectively, were tested against a control condition on three donor groups: active donors, inactive donors, and nondonors. Thus, a three\u2010by\u2010three factorial design was used on 910 adults in a Midwest city. Although the DIF was outperformed by the control across all three donor groups, the authors recommend its continued study in face\u2010to\u2010face donor solicitation. Importantly, the FID approach produced more donations than the control condition among active donors (Z = 4.30; p < .001), inactives (Z = 7.45; p < .001), and nondonors (Z = 1.98; p < .05). For managing the blood supply, the FID is particularly potent for rekindling donations from inactive donors.

Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation.

In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

However, existing meta-analyses use a broad definition of prosocial media that does not recognize the multidimensionality of prosocial behavior. The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering. Comparisons with other meta-analyses on media effects are made and implications for parents, media producers, and researchers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record\nJournal: Dev. Psychol.",

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

However, existing meta-analyses use a broad definition of prosocial media that does not recognize the multidimensionality of prosocial behavior. The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering. Comparisons with other meta-analyses on media effects are made and implications for parents, media producers, and researchers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record\nJournal: Dev.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

One of these proposed functions is the management of reputations. Reputation by itself has been shown to have a strong influence on cooperation dynamics in games of indirect reciprocity, and this notion helps to explain the observed high level of cooperation in humans. Here we designed a game to test a widespread assumption that gossip functions as a vector for the transmission of social information. This empirical study (with 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on the composition of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and the behavior based on gossip information. We show that gossip has a strong influence on the resulting behavior even when participants have access to the original information (i.e., direct observation) as well as gossip about the same information. Thus, it is evident that gossip has a strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip about cooperative individuals is more positive than gossip about uncooperative individuals, gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation levels are higher when people encounter positive compared with negative gossip. \u00a9 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.\nJournal: Proc.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support for presumed consent, though with variation in results that may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates b4 and after da introduction of legislation fir presumed consent (b4 and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries w and w/o presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: Da five b4 and after studies represented three countries: alll reported an increase in donation rates after da introduction of presumed consent, but dere was lil investigation of any other changes takin place concurrently w/ the change in legislation. In da four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated wit increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in da four studies. Other factors found to b important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, nasty domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of da UK public. Dese surveys varied in da level of support fir presumed consent, witt surveys conducted b4 2000 reporting da lowest levels of support (28-57%). Da most recent survey, in 2007, reported dat 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain da variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of da transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may alll play a part, but their relative importance is unclear.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

The public health implications of food insecurity are significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have the potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources are adequate, provisions of perishable food groups are available, and client needs are identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Dis review consolidates current knowledge abt the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Here we demonstrate that more subjects were willing to give assistance to unfamiliar people in need if they could make their charity offers in the presence of their group mates than in a situation where the offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willing to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores than others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness.

A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

The modules are all-inclusive, with a cross-cultural and international focus, requiring less preparation on the part of instructors and are easier for different types of students to use than existing online resources.

A basic model inspired by the theory of monopolistic competition is formulated and tested taking into account that some of the explanatory variables, such as fund-raising expenditure and price, are endogenous. The results show that the average donor is different for money and time donations and that government preferences differ from those of private donors.

A basic model inspired by the theory of monopolistic competition is formulated and tested taking into account that some of the explanatory variables, such as fund-raising expenditure and price, are endogenous. The results show that the average donor is different for money and time donations and that government preferences differ from those of private donors.

In humans, oestrogen-dependent characteristics of the female body correlate with health and reproductive fitness and are found attractive. Enhancing the sexual dimorphism of human faces should raise attractiveness by enhancing sex-hormone-related cues to youth and fertility in females, and to dominance and immunocompetence in males. Here we report the results of asking subjects to choose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced or diminished differences between the average shape of female and male faces. As predicted, subjects preferred feminized to average shapes of a female face. This preference applied across UK and Japanese populations but was stronger for within-population judgements, which indicates that attractiveness cues are learned. Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes of a male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increased both perceived dominance and negative attributions (for example, coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternal investment.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: The life you save may be your own\nAbstract: \nJournal: Problems in Public Expenditure Analysis\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: The life you save may be your own\nAbstract: \nJournal: Problems in Public Expenditure Analysis\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution.

However, redistribution leads to lower consumption for the contributors and therefore has a negative effect on contributions to the charity (income effect).

In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized independent of the ex-ante income inequality.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or bigass (30) number of stickers, and were then given da opportunity to share their windfall witt either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's givin was consistent wit a proportion- based account, such dat children typically donated a similar proportion (but diff absolute number) of da resources given to em, regardless of whether they originally received a small or bigass windfall. Da proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on da number of recipients witt whom they were allowed to share, such dat on average, children shared more when dere were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when wit prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated dat a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, w/ males generally sharing more resources den females. Together, findings suggest dat the numerical contexts under which children r asked to share, as well as da quantity of resources dat they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution.

The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.",

However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors. \u00a9 2019 Bilancini, Boncinelli and Mattiassi.\nJournal: Front.

The first technique utilizes a small antecedent request to encourage behavioral involvement and favorable disposition toward the target activity of the critical request to donate. The second approach frames the critical request as a concession following refusal of a very large request. The two techniques, dubbed the foot\u2010in\u2010the\u2010door (FID) and door\u2010in\u2010the\u2010face (DIF), respectively, were tested against a control condition on three donor groups: active donors, inactive donors, and nondonors. Thus, a three\u2010by\u2010three factorial design was used on 910 adults in a Midwest city. Although the DIF was outperformed by the control across all three donor groups, the authors recommend its continued study in face\u2010to\u2010face donor solicitation. Importantly, the FID approach produced more donations than the control condition among active donors (Z = 4.30; p < .001), inactives (Z = 7.45; p < .001), and nondonors (Z = 1.98; p < .05). For managing the blood supply, the FID is particularly potent for rekindling donations from inactive donors. Additional research on means of penetrating the nondonor segment is recommended. 1984 AABB\nJournal: Transfusion",

Although the DIF was outperformed by the control across all three donor groups, the authors recommend its continued study in face\u2010to\u2010face donor solicitation. Importantly, the FID approach produced more donations than the control condition among active donors (Z = 4.30; p < .001), inactives (Z = 7.45; p < .001), and nondonors (Z = 1.98; p < .05). For managing the blood supply, the FID is particularly potent for rekindling donations from inactive donors. Additional research on means of penetrating the nondonor segment is recommended. 1984 AABB\nJournal: Transfusion\nLabel:",

XCM: Da review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. Da search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced da possibility of language bias. It did not appear dat specific searches were undertaken fa unpublished studies, soo some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used fa quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed usin an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining da results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given da variability of da studies and da statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in da some of da meta-analyses.Da authors' conclusions reflect da evidence presented, but given da variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) da included studies, together w/ poor reporting of da review process, their reliability is uncertain. XIM: Practice: Da authors stated dat there may b a particular training need fir clinical officers in light of da increase in wound infection and dehiscence compared w doctors.Research: Da authors did not state any implications fir further research.\nJournal: \nLabel:",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.",

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients witt established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate da antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls r needed in treated hypertensive patients who r concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors cause even a small increase in BP may b associated w/ an important rise in da risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated witt a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. Dese data have been confirmed in randomized studies wid rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated w/ a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Dere is emerging evidence dat the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in da treatment of patients wid OA. Naproxcinod, da first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of da traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to da nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). Da molecule has da potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented da BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed w/ naproxen. Da BP benefit of naproxcinod ova naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers.

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health",

The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering.

Thus, it is evident that gossip has a strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip about cooperative individuals is more positive than gossip about uncooperative individuals, gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation levels are higher when people encounter positive compared with negative gossip. \u00a9 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.\nJournal: Proc.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support for presumed consent, though with variation in results that may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ",

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

The public health implications of food insecurity are significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have the potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources are adequate, provisions of perishable food groups are available, and client needs are identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.

Da public health implications of food insecurity r significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. Dis review consolidates current knowledge abt the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. Dis review found dat while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they r limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to da limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have da potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources r adequate, provisions of perishable food groups r available, and client needs r identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.

A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Da public health implications of food insecurity r significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. Dis review consolidates current knowledge abt the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. Dis review found dat while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they r limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to da limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have da potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources r adequate, provisions of perishable food groups r available, and client needs r identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.
