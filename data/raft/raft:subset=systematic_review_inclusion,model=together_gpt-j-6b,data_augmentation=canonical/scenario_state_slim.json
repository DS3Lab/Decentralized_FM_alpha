We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Dis paper presents a scoping review of empirical studies, published between 2007 and 2016, dat addressed influences on da choice of teachin as a career. Seventy articles were analysed descriptively and substantively. Our overview of da nature, extent, and range of research published in dem articles highlights dat most studies focus on motivations fa teaching, witt intrinsic and altruistic motivations most commonly identified. We argue dat a broader range of theoretical perspectives could add fresh insights to da question of y people claim teaching.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Heaa we demonstrate dat more subjects were willin to give assistance to unfamiliar mfs in need if they could make their charity offers in da presence of their group mates den in a shyt where da offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willin to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores den others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed dat while several personality and behavior traits (cooperative ability, Machiavellianism, sensitivity to norms, and sex) play a role in da development of prosocial behavior, da possibility of gaining reputation within da group remains a measurable determinant of charitable behavior. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

A theoretical background is presented. Then evidence is provided to support da idea dat emerging adulthood is a distinct period demographically, subjectively, and in terms of identity explorations. How emerging adulthood differs from adolescence and young adulthood is explained. Finally, a cultural context fir the idea of emerging adulthood is outlined, and it is specified dat emerging adulthood exists only in cultures dat allow young mfs a prolonged period of independent role exploration durin the late teens and twenties.\nJournal: Am.

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The modules are all-inclusive, with a cross-cultural and international focus, requiring less preparation on the part of instructors and are easier for different types of students to use than existing online resources. Education and research using the site can occur at the same time, each strengthening the other in the process. Rather than simply ethical understanding or the ability to reason ethically, research on moral psychology can ensure more ethical behaviors, better understanding what people know and think about ethics and the causes of (un)ethical behaviors. This research is cross-cultural, since culture has been shown to affect behaviors and thoughts related to ethics, and the educational and working environments of engineering are more cross-cultural and international than ever before. \u00a9 American Society for Engineering Education, 2019\nJournal: ASEE Annu.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The modules are all-inclusive, with a cross-cultural and international focus, requiring less preparation on the part of instructors and are easier for different types of students to use than existing online resources. Education and research using the site can occur at the same time, each strengthening the other in the process. Rather than simply ethical understanding or the ability to reason ethically, research on moral psychology can ensure more ethical behaviors, better understanding what people know and think about ethics and the causes of (un)ethical behaviors. This research is cross-cultural, since culture has been shown to affect behaviors and thoughts related to ethics, and the educational and working environments of engineering are more cross-cultural and international than ever before. \u00a9 American Society for Engineering Education, 2019\nJournal: ASEE Annu.

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In humans, oestrogen-dependent characteristics of the female body correlate with health and reproductive fitness and are found attractive. Enhancing the sexual dimorphism of human faces should raise attractiveness by enhancing sex-hormone-related cues to youth and fertility in females, and to dominance and immunocompetence in males. Here we report the results of asking subjects to choose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced or diminished differences between the average shape of female and male faces. As predicted, subjects preferred feminized to average shapes of a female face. This preference applied across UK and Japanese populations but was stronger for within-population judgements, which indicates that attractiveness cues are learned. Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes of a male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increased both perceived dominance and negative attributions (for example, coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternal investment. These results indicate a selection pressure that limits sexual dimorphism and encourages neoteny in humans.\nJournal: Nature",

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In humans, oestrogen-dependent characteristics of the female body correlate with health and reproductive fitness and are found attractive. Enhancing the sexual dimorphism of human faces should raise attractiveness by enhancing sex-hormone-related cues to youth and fertility in females, and to dominance and immunocompetence in males. Here we report the results of asking subjects to choose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced or diminished differences between the average shape of female and male faces.

Dis preference applied across UK and Japanese populations but was stronger fa within-population judgements, which indicates dat attractiveness cues r learned. Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes of a male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increased both perceived dominance and negative attributions (fir example, coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternal investment. Dem results indicate a selection pressure dat limits sexual dimorphism and encourages neoteny in humans.\nJournal: Nature\nLabel:",

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Participants given $1 to sign a homelessness petition were less likely to see theyself as altruistic den participants not given da monetary incentive. Da paid participants also complied less often w a request to wrk on a canned food drive 2 dayz later den unpaid participants. In contrast, participants tld they were helpful individuals were more likely to see theyself as altruistic and were more likely to volunteer fir the food drive den unlabeled participants. Mediation analyses provide evidence dat changes in self-concept underlie a successful foot-in-the-door manipulation and support da self-perception explanation fir the foot-in-the-door effect.\nJournal: Basic Appl.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized independent of the ex-ante income inequality.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

        "input": "Title: Being sticker rich: Numerical context influences children's sharing behavior\nAbstract: Young children spontaneously share resources with anonymous recipients, but little is known about the specific circumstances that promote or hinder these prosocial tendencies. Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Da test statistic is a direct statistical analogue of da popular 'funnel-graph.' Da number of component studies in da meta-analysis, da nature of da selection mechanism, da range of variances of da effect size estimates, and da true underlying effect size r all observed to b influential in determining da power of da test. Da test is fairly powerful fir large meta-analyses w/ 75 component studies, but has only moderate power fa meta-analyses w/ 25 component studies. However, in many of da configurations in which dere is low power, dere is also relatively lil bias in da summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, da test must b interpreted wit caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot b ruled outt if da test is not significant. Da proposed technique has potential utility as an exploratory tool fir meta-analysts, as a formal procedure to complement da funnel- graph.\nJournal: BIOMETRICS\nLabel:",

        "input": "Title: Social dilemma cooperation (unlike Dictator Game giving) is intuitive for men as well as women\nAbstract: Does intuition favor prosociality, or does prosocial behavior require deliberative self-control? The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.",

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.\nLabel:",

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Da hollow state is a metaphor fa the increasing use of third parties, often nonprofits, to deliver social services and generally act in da name of da state. Da types of structures, incentives, and mechanisms used to control third-party providers have been da focus of dis research. Da empirical thrust of dis research is on how effective various types of mechanisms, structures, and incentives r at promoting da effectiveness of contracted services. Da normative question dis research has raised, but not answered, is, Wat effect does government contracting w/ third-party providers have on da perceived legitimacy of da state? Dis article is a summary of da theoretical development and da empirical findings from da authors' research on da dimensions and impact of da hollow state in da domain of health and human services contracting. Elements of dis article have appeared previously in dis journal and in many others as well. Da article's purpose is to integrate da authors' research on da hollow state. Dis is a summative article dat seeks to bring together in one place wat the authors have learned. In addition, new directions r explored fa future research on da hollow state.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors. \u00a9 2019 Bilancini, Boncinelli and Mattiassi.\nJournal: Front.

The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21).

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

XCM: The review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. The search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced the possibility of language bias. It did not appear that specific searches were undertaken for unpublished studies, so some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used for quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed using an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining the results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given the variability of the studies and the statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in the some of the meta-analyses.The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented, but given the variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) the included studies, together with poor reporting of the review process, their reliability is uncertain. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that there may be a particular training need for clinical officers in light of the increase in wound infection and dehiscence compared with doctors.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.\nJournal: ",

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

XCM: The review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. The search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced the possibility of language bias. It did not appear that specific searches were undertaken for unpublished studies, so some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used for quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed using an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining the results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given the variability of the studies and the statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in the some of the meta-analyses.The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented, but given the variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) the included studies, together with poor reporting of the review process, their reliability is uncertain. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that there may be a particular training need for clinical officers in light of the increase in wound infection and dehiscence compared with doctors.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.\nJournal: \nLabel:",

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.",

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients witt established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate da antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls r needed in treated hypertensive patients who r concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors cause even a small increase in BP may b associated w/ an important rise in da risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated witt a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. Dese data have been confirmed in randomized studies wid rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated w/ a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Dere is emerging evidence dat the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in da treatment of patients wid OA. Naproxcinod, da first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of da traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to da nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). Da molecule has da potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented da BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed w/ naproxen. Da BP benefit of naproxcinod ova naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Dem investigational data suggest dat naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors fir treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.\nLabel:",

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health",

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

I show that if firms can organize themselves and choose the certification standard collectively, then there is a beneficial role for a regulator to intervene. Also, the degree of substitution between differentiated goods that impose environmental damage and a \u201cclean\u201d outside good, the degree of competition in the industry and the extent of environmental damage caused by minimal quality goods are important considerations in the choice between a certification program and a tax or a MQS. While the comparison between a certification program and a tax depends on numerous factors, I find unequivocally that certification is a poor substitute for taxation whenever the outside good is a close substitute for differentiated goods, there is a high degree of competition in the industry or if minimal quality goods impose considerable environmental damage. \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC\nJournal: J.

I show that if firms can organize themselves and choose the certification standard collectively, then there is a beneficial role for a regulator to intervene. Also, the degree of substitution between differentiated goods that impose environmental damage and a \u201cclean\u201d outside good, the degree of competition in the industry and the extent of environmental damage caused by minimal quality goods are important considerations in the choice between a certification program and a tax or a MQS. While the comparison between a certification program and a tax depends on numerous factors, I find unequivocally that certification is a poor substitute for taxation whenever the outside good is a close substitute for differentiated goods, there is a high degree of competition in the industry or if minimal quality goods impose considerable environmental damage. \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC\nJournal: J.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21).

Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Latane (see record) study of bystander aid to a seizure victim examining da effects of (a) number and competence of bystanders, (b) information appropriate fir action, and (c) ascription of responsibility (AR) upon helpin by males and females. From an analysis of norms relevant in an emergency and of da likelihood of their activation, main effects on speed of helpin for da above 4 variables, interactions of da 1st 3 w AR, a Sex of Subject \u00d7 Number interaction, and differences in type of help offered in various conditions were predicted. 179 undergraduates participated in a factorial experiment. Speed of helpin dropped significantly fir females, but not fa males, when other bystanders were present (reporting decreased, direct help was unaffected), and dropped significantly further when anotha bystander was medically competent (reporting increased, direct help decreased). Among females disposed to accept rationales fir denying responsibility, both effects were particularly strong. Information-action and AR to da self were associated w/ faster and more direct help. Data on Ss' thoughts and feelins reinforced a normative interpretation of da results.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.\nJournal: J.

Da public health implications of food insecurity r significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. Dis review consolidates current knowledge abt the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. Dis review found dat while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they r limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to da limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have da potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources r adequate, provisions of perishable food groups r available, and client needs r identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Here we demonstrate that more subjects were willing to give assistance to unfamiliar people in need if they could make their charity offers in the presence of their group mates than in a situation where the offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willing to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores than others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that while several personality and behavior traits (cooperative ability, Machiavellianism, sensitivity to norms, and sex) play a role in the development of prosocial behavior, the possibility of gaining reputation within the group remains a measurable determinant of charitable behavior. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique.

A theoretical background is presented. Then evidence is provided to support da idea dat emerging adulthood is a distinct period demographically, subjectively, and in terms of identity explorations. How emerging adulthood differs from adolescence and young adulthood is explained. Finally, a cultural context fir the idea of emerging adulthood is outlined, and it is specified dat emerging adulthood exists only in cultures dat allow young mfs a prolonged period of independent role exploration durin the late teens and twenties.\nJournal: Am.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

However, related donors can face significant physical and psychosocial challenges. As the demand for adult\u2010related HSC donors is increasing, it is important to review our understanding of adult\u2010related HSC donors\u2019 need for and availability of information and psychosocial support with a view to identifying gaps in the literature. A systematic review of relevant studies (2000\u20132017) was conducted using five databases with supplementary hand searching. Sixteen studies involving 1,024 related HSC donors met the following criteria: English or Dutch language, peer\u2010reviewed, sampled first\u2010time\u2010related HSC donors, \u2265 18 years, haematological malignancies, assessed psychosocial aspects, retrospective or prospective and with or without comparison group.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

A basic model inspired by da theory of monopolistic competition is formulated and tested takin into account dat some of da explanatory variables, such as fund-raising expenditure and price, r endogenous. Da results show dat the average donor is diffrent for paper and time donations and dat government preferences differ from those of private donors. Finally, da authors find dat the hypothesis of efficient fund-raising expenditures cannot b rejected.\nJournal: Public Financ. Rev.\nLabel:",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

In humans, oestrogen-dependent characteristics of the female body correlate with health and reproductive fitness and are found attractive. Enhancing the sexual dimorphism of human faces should raise attractiveness by enhancing sex-hormone-related cues to youth and fertility in females, and to dominance and immunocompetence in males. Here we report the results of asking subjects to choose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced or diminished differences between the average shape of female and male faces. As predicted, subjects preferred feminized to average shapes of a female face. This preference applied across UK and Japanese populations but was stronger for within-population judgements, which indicates that attractiveness cues are learned. Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes of a male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increased both perceived dominance and negative attributions (for example, coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternal investment. These results indicate a selection pressure that limits sexual dimorphism and encourages neoteny in humans.\nJournal: Nature",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Redistribution has two opposite effects on voluntary giving. The price of charitable giving decreases with the degree of redistribution, and this has a positive effect on the total amount of giving (substitution effect). However, redistribution leads to lower consumption for the contributors and therefore has a negative effect on contributions to the charity (income effect). The theoretical model developed in this paper demonstrates that, under a general class of utility functions, the substitution effect dominates the income effect. Hence, charitable giving increases with the tax rate. In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized independent of the ex-ante income inequality. However, the positive impact of taxation on charitable giving and welfare may disappear if individuals generate their income levels in anticipation of taxation and redistribution does not take into account the cost of effort. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia.

The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Da Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates dat intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both da individual and da context. Fa example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like da Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays offf because of da opportunity fir reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in da Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG givin can b long-run advantageous cause of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, da SHH predicts dat intuition gon favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG givin among women. Heaa I present meta-analytic evidence in support of dis prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find dat promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent fir both men and women. Dis stands in contrast to da results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes givin among women but not men. Furthermore, I show usin meta-regression dat the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in da DG compared to da cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence dat the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both settin and individual as predicted by da SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.\nLabel:",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors. \u00a9 2019 Bilancini, Boncinelli and Mattiassi.\nJournal: Front.

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

The first technique utilizes a small antecedent request to encourage behavioral involvement and favorable disposition toward the target activity of the critical request to donate. The second approach frames the critical request as a concession following refusal of a very large request. The two techniques, dubbed the foot\u2010in\u2010the\u2010door (FID) and door\u2010in\u2010the\u2010face (DIF), respectively, were tested against a control condition on three donor groups: active donors, inactive donors, and nondonors. Thus, a three\u2010by\u2010three factorial design was used on 910 adults in a Midwest city. Although the DIF was outperformed by the control across all three donor groups, the authors recommend its continued study in face\u2010to\u2010face donor solicitation. Importantly, the FID approach produced more donations than the control condition among active donors (Z = 4.30; p < .001), inactives (Z = 7.45; p < .001), and nondonors (Z = 1.98; p < .05). For managing the blood supply, the FID is particularly potent for rekindling donations from inactive donors.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health",

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health\nLabel:",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

However, existing meta-analyses use a broad definition of prosocial media that does not recognize the multidimensionality of prosocial behavior. The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering. Comparisons with other meta-analyses on media effects are made and implications for parents, media producers, and researchers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record\nJournal: Dev. Psychol.",

However, existing meta-analyses use a broad definition of prosocial media that does not recognize the multidimensionality of prosocial behavior. The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering. Comparisons with other meta-analyses on media effects are made and implications for parents, media producers, and researchers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record\nJournal: Dev.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

I show that if firms can organize themselves and choose the certification standard collectively, then there is a beneficial role for a regulator to intervene. Also, the degree of substitution between differentiated goods that impose environmental damage and a \u201cclean\u201d outside good, the degree of competition in the industry and the extent of environmental damage caused by minimal quality goods are important considerations in the choice between a certification program and a tax or a MQS. While the comparison between a certification program and a tax depends on numerous factors, I find unequivocally that certification is a poor substitute for taxation whenever the outside good is a close substitute for differentiated goods, there is a high degree of competition in the industry or if minimal quality goods impose considerable environmental damage. \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC\nJournal: J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

I show that if firms can organize themselves and choose the certification standard collectively, then there is a beneficial role for a regulator to intervene. Also, the degree of substitution between differentiated goods that impose environmental damage and a \u201cclean\u201d outside good, the degree of competition in the industry and the extent of environmental damage caused by minimal quality goods are important considerations in the choice between a certification program and a tax or a MQS. While the comparison between a certification program and a tax depends on numerous factors, I find unequivocally that certification is a poor substitute for taxation whenever the outside good is a close substitute for differentiated goods, there is a high degree of competition in the industry or if minimal quality goods impose considerable environmental damage. \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

One of dese proposed functions is da management of reputations. Reputation by itself has been shown to have a strong influence on cooperation dynamics in games of indirect reciprocity, and dis notion helps to explain da observed high level of cooperation in humans. Heaa we designed a game to test a widespread assumption dat gossip functions as a vector fir the transmission of social information. Dis empirical study (witt 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on da composition of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and da behavior based on gossip information. We show dat gossip has a strong influence on da resulting behavior even when participants have access to da original information (i.e., direct observation) as well as gossip bout the same information. Thus, it is evident dat gossip has a strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip abt cooperative individuals is more positive den gossip abt uncooperative individuals, gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation levels r higher when mfs encounter positive compared witt negative gossip. \u00a9 2007 by Da National Academy of Sciences of da USA.\nJournal: Proc.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support for presumed consent, though with variation in results that may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ",

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates b4 and after da introduction of legislation fir presumed consent (b4 and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries w and w/o presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: Da five b4 and after studies represented three countries: alll reported an increase in donation rates after da introduction of presumed consent, but dere was lil investigation of any other changes takin place concurrently w/ the change in legislation. In da four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated wit increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in da four studies. Other factors found to b important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, nasty domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of da UK public. Dese surveys varied in da level of support fir presumed consent, witt surveys conducted b4 2000 reporting da lowest levels of support (28-57%). Da most recent survey, in 2007, reported dat 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain da variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of da transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may alll play a part, but their relative importance is unclear.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia.

Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.\nJournal: Am.

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism\nAbstract: California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon.

Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nJournal: J.

This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted.

This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits.

To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.\nJournal: J. Crit.

Here we demonstrate that more subjects were willing to give assistance to unfamiliar people in need if they could make their charity offers in the presence of their group mates than in a situation where the offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willing to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores than others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that while several personality and behavior traits (cooperative ability, Machiavellianism, sensitivity to norms, and sex) play a role in the development of prosocial behavior, the possibility of gaining reputation within the group remains a measurable determinant of charitable behavior. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A theoretical background is presented. Then evidence is provided to support da idea dat emerging adulthood is a distinct period demographically, subjectively, and in terms of identity explorations. How emerging adulthood differs from adolescence and young adulthood is explained. Finally, a cultural context fir the idea of emerging adulthood is outlined, and it is specified dat emerging adulthood exists only in cultures dat allow young mfs a prolonged period of independent role exploration durin the late teens and twenties.\nJournal: Am.

Da results show dat the average donor is diffrent for paper and time donations and dat government preferences differ from those of private donors. Finally, da authors find dat the hypothesis of efficient fund-raising expenditures cannot b rejected.\nJournal: Public Financ. Rev.\nLabel:",

Redistribution has two opposite effects on voluntary giving. The price of charitable giving decreases with the degree of redistribution, and this has a positive effect on the total amount of giving (substitution effect). However, redistribution leads to lower consumption for the contributors and therefore has a negative effect on contributions to the charity (income effect). The theoretical model developed in this paper demonstrates that, under a general class of utility functions, the substitution effect dominates the income effect. Hence, charitable giving increases with the tax rate. In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized independent of the ex-ante income inequality. However, the positive impact of taxation on charitable giving and welfare may disappear if individuals generate their income levels in anticipation of taxation and redistribution does not take into account the cost of effort. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. \u00a9 2015 Posid et al.

The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.\nJournal: J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.",

However, soo far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to b successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is da development of a measure of strategic ability dat borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of da likelihood of success in many social activities dat involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, dat we propose to call \"Strategic Quotient\" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, da individual obtained score depends on da distribution of choices of other decision-makers takin the test. Da test is designed to provide information on da abilities related to 2 dimensions, mentalization and rationality, dat we argue r crucial to strategic success, wit each dimension bein characterized by 2 main factors.

Importantly, da FID approach produced more donations den the control condition among active donors (Z = 4.30; p < .001), inactives (Z = 7.45; p < .001), and nondonors (Z = 1.98; p < .05). Fir managing da blood supply, da FID is particularly potent fa rekindling donations from inactive donors.

Da first technique utilizes a small antecedent request to encourage behavioral involvement and favorable disposition toward da target activity of da critical request to donate. Da second approach frames da critical request as a concession following refusal of a very bigass request. Da two techniques, dubbed da foot\u2010in\u2010da\u2010door (FID) and door\u2010in\u2010da\u2010face (DIF), respectively, were tested against a control condition on three donor groups: active donors, inactive donors, and nondonors. Thus, a three\u2010by\u2010three factorial design was used on 910 adults in a Burg city. Although da DIF was outperformed by da control across alll three donor groups, da authors recommend its continued study in face\u2010to\u2010face donor solicitation.

XCM: Da review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. Da search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced da possibility of language bias. It did not appear dat specific searches were undertaken fa unpublished studies, soo some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used fa quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed usin an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining da results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given da variability of da studies and da statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in da some of da meta-analyses.Da authors' conclusions reflect da evidence presented, but given da variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) da included studies, together w/ poor reporting of da review process, their reliability is uncertain.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.",

Dese data have been confirmed in randomized studies wid rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated w/ a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Dere is emerging evidence dat the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in da treatment of patients wid OA. Naproxcinod, da first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of da traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to da nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). Da molecule has da potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented da BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed w/ naproxen. Da BP benefit of naproxcinod ova naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Dem investigational data suggest dat naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors fir treatment of OA patients.\nJournal: Ther. Adv. Musculoskelet. Dis.",

A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health",

A systematic review was conducted to describe da empirical evidence bou episodic volunteering (EV) in da public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals dat identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in da health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to da health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was da most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined da economic costs of EV. Thea was lil consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helpin others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin da development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies fa the health and social welfare sectors.\nJournal: BMC Public Health",

The current paper extends Peterson's (2004, Journal of Business Ethics 49, 371) study by exploring a unique form of employee volunteerism identified as intra-organizational, or employer-sanctioned volunteerism, and uniting the heretofore distinct charity support and organizational citizenship behavior literatures. Results of a preliminary study revealed that employee participation in such intra-organizational volunteer programs is motivated by charity, firm, and personal benefits.

The current paper extends Peterson's (2004, Journal of Business Ethics 49, 371) study by exploring a unique form of employee volunteerism identified as intra-organizational, or employer-sanctioned volunteerism, and uniting the heretofore distinct charity support and organizational citizenship behavior literatures. Results of a preliminary study revealed that employee participation in such intra-organizational volunteer programs is motivated by charity, firm, and personal benefits.

One of dese proposed functions is da management of reputations. Reputation by itself has been shown to have a strong influence on cooperation dynamics in games of indirect reciprocity, and dis notion helps to explain da observed high level of cooperation in humans. Heaa we designed a game to test a widespread assumption dat gossip functions as a vector fir the transmission of social information. Dis empirical study (witt 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on da composition of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and da behavior based on gossip information. We show dat gossip has a strong influence on da resulting behavior even when participants have access to da original information (i.e., direct observation) as well as gossip bout the same information. Thus, it is evident dat gossip has a strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip abt cooperative individuals is more positive den gossip abt uncooperative individuals, gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation levels r higher when mfs encounter positive compared witt negative gossip. \u00a9 2007 by Da National Academy of Sciences of da USA.\nJournal: Proc.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support for presumed consent, though with variation in results that may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ",

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates b4 and after da introduction of legislation fir presumed consent (b4 and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries w and w/o presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: Da five b4 and after studies represented three countries: alll reported an increase in donation rates after da introduction of presumed consent, but dere was lil investigation of any other changes takin place concurrently w/ the change in legislation. In da four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated wit increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in da four studies. Other factors found to b important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, nasty domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of da UK public. Dese surveys varied in da level of support fir presumed consent, witt surveys conducted b4 2000 reporting da lowest levels of support (28-57%). Da most recent survey, in 2007, reported dat 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain da variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of da transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may alll play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support fa presumed consent, tho with variation in results dat may reflect differences in survey methods.\nJournal: BMJ",

Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.\nJournal: IEEE Comput Graphics Appl\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: The life you save may be your own\nAbstract: \nJournal: Problems in Public Expenditure Analysis\nLabel: not included\n\nTitle: Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis\nAbstract: The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.\nJournal: J.

Da public health implications of food insecurity r significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. Dis review consolidates current knowledge abt the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. Dis review found dat while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they r limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to da limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have da potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources r adequate, provisions of perishable food groups r available, and client needs r identified and addressed.\nJournal: J.
