It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals.

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

If da class-conditional distributions have sum overlap, training instances in da nonoverlapping region can still b labeled witt no uncertainty, while training instances in da overlapping regions can have their labels guessed witt some uncertainty, depending on da degree of overlap.\nPaper title: Learnin from Label Proportions: A Mutual Contamination Framework\nLabel:",

Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points.

A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Da problem of Byzantine resilient aggregation of distributed machine learnin models has been actively studied in recent yrs; however, da issue of Byzantine resilient distributed learnin in multi-task networks has received much less attention. It is a general intuition dat MTL is robust and resilient to cyber-attacks since it can identify attackers by measuring similarities between neighbors. In dis paper, we have shown dat some commonly used similarity measures r not resilient against certain attacks. W an increase in data heterogeneity, we hope dis work could highlight da security and privacy concerns in designing distributed MTL frameworks.\nPaper title: Byzantine Resilient Distributed Multi-Task Learning\nLabel:",

For example, more accurate individualized models for user-generated data could be used in a negative fashion for applications such as surveillance (e.g., to monitor and negatively impact individuals in protected groups).

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework.

Make sure the statement is sufficient to conclude there are harmful applications of the research being done, not a past risk that this research is solving.\nPossible labels:\n1. doesn't mention a harmful application\n2. mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: While many of da successful and highly-visible applications of machine learnin are in classification and regression, dere are a broad range of applications dat don\u2019t naturally fit into dese categories and dat can potentially benefit significantly from machine learnin approaches.

        "input": "Impact statement: We have provided a thorough analysis of the privacy and utility properties of the discrete Gaussian and the practicality of sampling it. The impact of this work is that it makes the real-world deployment of differential privacy more practical and secure. In particular, we bridge the gap between the theory (which considers continuous distributions) and the practice (where precision is finite and numerical errors can cause a dramatic privacy failures). We hope that the discrete Gaussian will be used in practice and, further, that our work is critical to enabling these real-world deployments. The positive impact of this work is clear: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. If this technology is adopted, it can provide untrusted third parties controlled access to data (e.g., to enable scientific research), while affording the data subjects (i.e., the general public) an adequate level of privacy protection. In any case, our methods are better than using flawed methods (i.e., na\u00efve floating-point implementations of continuous distributions) that inject noise without actually protecting privacy or using methods (such as rounding or discrete Laplace) that offer a worse privacy-utility tradeoff. The negative impact of this work is less clear. All technologies can be misused. For example, an organization may be able to deceptively claim that their system protects privacy on the basis that it is differentially private, when, in reality, it is not private at all, because their privacy parameter is enormous (e.g., \u03b5 = 10 6 ). One needs to be careful and critical about promises made by such companies, and educate the general audience about what differential privacy does provide, what it does not, and when guarantees end up being meaningless. However, we must acknowledge that there is a small \u2013 but vocal \u2013 group of people who do not want differential privacy to be deployed in practice. In particular, the US Census Bureau\u2019s planned adoption of differential privacy for the 2020 US Census has met staunch opposition from some social scientists. We cannot speak for the opponents of differential privacy; many of their objections do not make sense to us and thus it would be inappropriate for us to try summarizing them. However, there is a salient point that needs to be discussed: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. This is good, in theory, but, in practice, privacy versus utility is a heated and muddy debate. On one hand, data users (such as social scientists) want unfettered access to the raw data. On the other hand, privacy advocates want the data locked up or never collected in the first place. The technology of differential privacy offers a vehicle for compromise. Yet, some parties are not interested in compromise. In particular, users of census data users are accustomed to largely unrestricted data access. From a privacy perspective, this is unsustainable \u2013 the development of reconstruction attacks and the availability of large auxiliary datasets for linking/re-identification has shown that census data needs more robust protections. Understandably, those who rely on census data are deeply concerned about anything that may compromise their ability to conduct research. The adoption of differential privacy has prompted uncomfortable (but necessary) discussions about the value of providing data access relative to the privacy cost. In particular, it is necessary to decide how to allocate the privacy budget \u2013 which statistics are most important to release accurately? Another dimension of the privacy-versus-utility debate is how it affects small communities, such as racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations. Smaller populations inherently suffer a harsher privacy- utility tradeoff. Differential privacy is almost always defined so that it provides every person with an equal level of privacy. Consequently, differentially private statistics for smaller populations (e.g., Native Americans in a small settlement) will be less accurate than for larger populations (e.g., Whites in a large US city). More precisely, noise addition methods like ours offer the same absolute accuracy on all populations, but the relative accuracy will be worse when the denominator (i.e., population size) is smaller. The only alternative is to offer small communities weaker privacy protections. We stress that this issue is not specific to differential privacy. For example, if we rely on anonymity or de-identification, then we must grapple with the fact that minorities are more easily re-identified, since, by definition, minorities are more unique. This is a fundamental tradeoff that needs to be carefully considered with input from the minorities and communities concerned. Ultimately, computer scientists can only provide tools and it is up to policymakers in government and other organizations to decide how to use them. This work, along with the broader literature on differential privacy, provides such tools.

Da impact of dis work is dat it makes da real-world deployment of differential privacy more practical and secure. In particular, we bridge da gap between da theory (which considers continuous distributions) and da practice (where precision is finite and numerical errors can cus a petty privacy failures). We hope dat the discrete Gaussian gon be used in practice and, further, dat our wrk is critical to enabling dese real-world deployments. Da positive impact of dis work is clear: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. If dis technology is adopted, it can provide untrusted third parties controlled access to data (e.g., to enable scientific research), while affording da data subjects (i.e., da general public) an adequate level of privacy protection. In any case, our methods r better den using flawed methods (i.e., na\u00efve floating-point implementations of continuous distributions) dat inject noise w/o actually protecting privacy or usin methods (such as rounding or discrete Laplace) dat offer a worse privacy-utility tradeoff. Da negative impact of dis work is less clear. Alll technologies can b misused. Fir example, an organization may b able to deceptively claim dat their system protects privacy on da basis dat it is differentially private, when, in reality, it is not private at alll, cause their privacy parameter is enormous (e.g., \u03b5 = 10 6 ). One needs to b careful and critical bou promises made by such companies, and educate da general audience abt what differential privacy does provide, wht it does not, and when guarantees end up bein meaningless. However, we must acknowledge dat there is a small \u2013 but vocal \u2013 group of niggas who do not want differential privacy to b deployed in practice. In particular, da US Census Bureau\u2019s planned adoption of differential privacy fa the 2020 US Census has met staunch opposition from sum social scientists. We cannot speak fa the opponents of differential privacy; many of their objections do not make sense to us and thus it would b inappropriate fa us to try summarizing em. However, dere is a salient point dat needs to b discussed: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. Dis is gud, in theory, but, in practice, privacy versus utility is a heated and muddy debate. On one hand, data users (such as social scientists) want unfettered access to da raw data. On da other hand, privacy advocates want da data locked up or never collected in da first place. Da technology of differential privacy offers a vehicle fa compromise. Yet, sum parties r not interested in compromise. In particular, users of census data users r accustomed to largely unrestricted data access. From a privacy perspective, dis is unsustainable \u2013 da development of reconstruction attacks and da availability of bigass auxiliary datasets fa linking/re-identification has shown dat census data needs more robust protections. Understandably, those who rely on census data r deeply talkn about anything dat may compromise their ability to conduct research. Da adoption of differential privacy has prompted uncomfortable (but necessary) discussions bout the value of providing data access relative to da privacy cost. In particular, it is necessary to decide how to allocate da privacy budget \u2013 which statistics r most important to release accurately? Anotha dimension of da privacy-versus-utility debate is how it affects small communities, such as racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations. Smaller populations inherently suffer a harsher privacy- utility tradeoff. Differential privacy is almost always defined soo that it provides every person wid an equal level of privacy. Consequently, differentially private statistics fa smaller populations (e.g., Native Americans in a small settlement) gon be less accurate den for larger populations (e.g., Whites in a bigass US city). More precisely, noise addition methods like ours offer da same absolute accuracy on alll populations, but da relative accuracy gon be worse when da denominator (i.e., population size) is smaller. Da only alternative is to offer small communities weaker privacy protections. We stress dat this issue is not specific to differential privacy. Fa example, if we rely on anonymity or de-identification, then we must grapple w/ the fact dat minorities r more easily re-identified, since, by definition, minorities r more unique. Dis is a fundamental tradeoff dat needs to b carefully considered witt input from da minorities and communities talkn. Ultimately, computer scientists can only provide tools and it is up to policymakers in government and other organizations to decide how to use em. Dis work, along wid the broader literature on differential privacy, provides such tools. However, da research community also has a responsibility to provide instructions fir how dese tools should and should not b used.\nPaper title: Da Discrete Gaussian fir Differential Privacy",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: We have provided a thorough analysis of da privacy and utility properties of da discrete Gaussian and da practicality of sampling it.

However, we must acknowledge dat there is a small \u2013 but vocal \u2013 group of niggas who do not want differential privacy to b deployed in practice. In particular, da US Census Bureau\u2019s planned adoption of differential privacy fa the 2020 US Census has met staunch opposition from sum social scientists. We cannot speak fa the opponents of differential privacy; many of their objections do not make sense to us and thus it would b inappropriate fa us to try summarizing em. However, dere is a salient point dat needs to b discussed: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. Dis is gud, in theory, but, in practice, privacy versus utility is a heated and muddy debate. On one hand, data users (such as social scientists) want unfettered access to da raw data. On da other hand, privacy advocates want da data locked up or never collected in da first place. Da technology of differential privacy offers a vehicle fa compromise. Yet, sum parties r not interested in compromise. In particular, users of census data users r accustomed to largely unrestricted data access. From a privacy perspective, dis is unsustainable \u2013 da development of reconstruction attacks and da availability of bigass auxiliary datasets fa linking/re-identification has shown dat census data needs more robust protections. Understandably, those who rely on census data r deeply talkn about anything dat may compromise their ability to conduct research. Da adoption of differential privacy has prompted uncomfortable (but necessary) discussions bout the value of providing data access relative to da privacy cost. In particular, it is necessary to decide how to allocate da privacy budget \u2013 which statistics r most important to release accurately? Anotha dimension of da privacy-versus-utility debate is how it affects small communities, such as racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations. Smaller populations inherently suffer a harsher privacy- utility tradeoff. Differential privacy is almost always defined soo that it provides every person wid an equal level of privacy. Consequently, differentially private statistics fa smaller populations (e.g., Native Americans in a small settlement) gon be less accurate den for larger populations (e.g., Whites in a bigass US city). More precisely, noise addition methods like ours offer da same absolute accuracy on alll populations, but da relative accuracy gon be worse when da denominator (i.e., population size) is smaller. Da only alternative is to offer small communities weaker privacy protections. We stress dat this issue is not specific to differential privacy. Fa example, if we rely on anonymity or de-identification, then we must grapple w/ the fact dat minorities r more easily re-identified, since, by definition, minorities r more unique. Dis is a fundamental tradeoff dat needs to b carefully considered witt input from da minorities and communities talkn. Ultimately, computer scientists can only provide tools and it is up to policymakers in government and other organizations to decide how to use em. Dis work, along wid the broader literature on differential privacy, provides such tools. However, da research community also has a responsibility to provide instructions fir how dese tools should and should not b used.\nPaper title: Da Discrete Gaussian fir Differential Privacy\nLabel:",

We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework.

While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Any method that learns from finite data is subject to statistical estimation errors and model assumptions that necessarily limit the full applicability of its findings.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Any method dat learns from finite data is subject to statistical estimation errors and model assumptions dat necessarily limit da full applicability of its findings.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement:   this work  touches apon  a very old   probelm  dating  back  to   1933   and   the work  of   [39].   therefore,  we   don\u2019t anticipate any  new  societal impacts or   ethical   aspects, that  aren't   well  understood   by now.\npaper  title:  finite-time   analysis of   round-robin   kullback-leibler  upper  confidence   bounds   for   optimal adaptive allocation with  multiple  plays and   markovian  rewards\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement: this research   constitutes a  technical advance by  employing constraint  projection   operations  to enhance the  prediction  capability of  physical systems   with unknown dynamics.  it  opens   up   new possibilities  to  effectively   and intuitively  represent complicated   physical   systems   from   direct and  limited observation.  this   research blend the  borders   among   the  communities of machine learning and  fast   physics simulations  in   cmoputer  graphics  and  gaming  inudstry.  our model   doesn't  neccesarily bring   baout   any   significant   ethical   considerations.\npaper  title: learning   physical  constraints with  neural   projections\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent.

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks.

We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more.

While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement:  gcns  could be applied to  a  wide  range  of   applications,  incuding   image  segmentation   [27],   speech   recognition  [14],  recommender system  [17],   point  cloud   [50, 24],  traffic   prediction   [25]   and   many   more  [45].   our   method  can   help to   expand   the   graph  types from undirected  to   directed in  the   above  application  scenarios  and   obtain   multi-scale features from  the high-order   hidden   directed structure.  for  traffic prediction,   our  method   can be  used  in   map   applicaitons   to obtain   more   fine-grained and  accurate   predictions.   this  requires users  to   provide   location information,   which has a  risk of privacy leakage.   the same   concerns aslo   arise   in social  network  analysis  [38],   person  re-id   [35] and nlp   [49], which use  graph   convolutional   networks as  their  feature extraction   methods.   another potential   risk is   that our model  may  be adversarial  attacked by  adding new   nodes or deleting   existing   edges.  for exmaple,   in   a  graph-based recommender   system,  our  model may  produce   completely   different   recommendation results  due  to   beng   attacked.   we see   opportunities   for research  applying digcn to benificial  purposes,  such as investigating   the ability   of digcn   to disover hidden complex   directed  structure, the  limitation  of  approximate method  based   on   personalized  pagerank and  the feature   oversmoothing   problem   in digraphs.  we   also encourage  follow-up   research to  design   derivative  methods for different tasks  based   on   our   method.\npaper  title:   digraph inception convolutional  networks\nLabel:",

        "input": "Impact statement: Uncertainty estimation for neural networks has very significant societal impact. Neural networks are increasingly being trained as black-box predictors and being placed in larger decision systems where errors in their predictions can pose immediate threat to downstream tasks. Systematic methods for calibrated uncertainty estimation under these conditions are needed, especially as these systems are deployed in safety critical domains, such for autonomous vehicle control [29], medical diagnosis [43], or in settings with large dataset imbalances and bias such as crime forecasting [24] and facial recognition [3]. This work is complementary to a large portion of machine learning research which is continually pushing the boundaries on neural network precision and accuracy. Instead of solely optimizing larger models for increased performance, our method focuses on how these models can be equipped with the ability to estimate their own confidence. Our results demonstrating superior calibration of our method over baselines are also critical in ensuring that we can place a certain level of trust in these algorithms and in understanding when they say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. While there are clear and broad benefits of uncertainty estimation in machine learning, we believe it is also important to recognize potential societal challenges that may arise. With increased performance and uncertainty estimation capabilities, humans will inevitably become increasingly trusting in a model\u2019s predictions, as well as its ability to catch dangerous or uncertain decisions before they are executed. Thus, it is important to continue to pursue redundancy in such learning systems to increase the likelihood that mistakes can be caught and corrected independently.\nPaper title: Deep Evidential Regression",

Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Uncertainty estimation for neural networks has very significant societal impact. Neural networks are increasingly being trained as black-box predictors and being placed in larger decision systems where errors in their predictions can pose immediate threat to downstream tasks. Systematic methods for calibrated uncertainty estimation under these conditions are needed, especially as these systems are deployed in safety critical domains, such for autonomous vehicle control [29], medical diagnosis [43], or in settings with large dataset imbalances and bias such as crime forecasting [24] and facial recognition [3]. This work is complementary to a large portion of machine learning research which is continually pushing the boundaries on neural network precision and accuracy. Instead of solely optimizing larger models for increased performance, our method focuses on how these models can be equipped with the ability to estimate their own confidence. Our results demonstrating superior calibration of our method over baselines are also critical in ensuring that we can place a certain level of trust in these algorithms and in understanding when they say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. While there are clear and broad benefits of uncertainty estimation in machine learning, we believe it is also important to recognize potential societal challenges that may arise. With increased performance and uncertainty estimation capabilities, humans will inevitably become increasingly trusting in a model\u2019s predictions, as well as its ability to catch dangerous or uncertain decisions before they are executed. Thus, it is important to continue to pursue redundancy in such learning systems to increase the likelihood that mistakes can be caught and corrected independently.\nPaper title: Deep Evidential Regression\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

Our results demonstrating superior calibration of our method ova baselines r also critical in ensuring dat we can place a certain level of trust in dem algorithms and in understanding when they say \u201cI don\u2019t kno\u201d. While thea are clear and broad benefits of uncertainty estimation in machine learnin, we believe it is also important to recognize potential societal challenges dat may arise. Wid increased performance and uncertainty estimation capabilities, humans gon inevitably become increasingly trusting in a model\u2019s predictions, as well as its ability to catch dangerous or uncertain decisions b4 they r executed. Thus, it is important to continue to pursue redundancy in such learnin systems to increase da likelihood dat mistakes can b caught and corrected independently.\nPaper title: Deep Evidential Regression\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio.

This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent.

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work does not present any foreseeable societal consequence.\nPaper title: Improving Local Identifiability in Probabilistic Box Embeddings\nLabel:",

We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework.

Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent.

Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks.

We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Deepfake refers to synthesized media in which a portrait of a person in real media is replaced by that of someone else.

Equivalently, our work extends core methods in changepoint detection, enabling the use of highly expressive predictive models via empirical Bayes. This work has the potential to extend the domain of applicability of both of these methods. Standard meta-learning relies on a collection of datasets, each corresponding to discrete tasks. A natural question is how such datasets are constructed; in many cases, these datasets rely on segmentation of time series data by experts. Thus, our work has the potential to make meta-learning algorithms applicable to problems that, previously, would have been too expensive or impossible to segment. Moreover, our work has the potential to improve the applicability of changepoint detection methods to difficult time series forecasting problems. While MOCA has the potential to expand the domain of problems addressable via meta-learning, this has the effect of amplifying the risks associated with these methods. Meta-learning enables efficient learning for individual members of a population via leveraging empirical priors. There are clear risks in few-shot learning generally: for example, efficient facial recognition from a handful of images has clear negative implications for privacy. Moreover, while there is promising initial work on fairness for meta-learning [39], we believe considerable future research is required to understand the degree to which meta-learning algorithms increase undesirable bias or decrease fairness. While it is plausible that fine-tuning to the individual results in reduced bias, there are potential unforeseen risks associated with the adaptation process, and future research should address how bias is potentially introduced in this process. Relative to decision making rules that are fixed across a population, algorithms which fine-tune decision making to the individual present unique challenges in analyzing fairness.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework.

This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our wrk provides a method to extend meta-learning algorithms beyond da task-segmented case, to da time series series domain.

Make sure the statement is sufficient to conclude there are harmful applications of the research being done, not a past risk that this research is solving.\nPossible labels:\n1. doesn't mention a harmful application\n2. mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement:   (as   required by  neurips 2020   cfp)   continual learning  is  a  key  desiderata  for  artificial  general   intelligence   (agi). hence,   this line   of   research  has   the benefits   as well   as   the   pitfalls   of  any  other  research  affort  geared  in  this  direction. in   particular, our  work   can halp   deliver   impact  on making smarter   ai products and services, which   can learn  and update  themselves on-the-fly when   newer tasks and domains are encountered,   without forgetting previously  acquired knowledge.   this   is  a necessity  in   any  large-scale   deployments   of   machine learning   and  computer vision, including   in  social media,  e-commerce, surveillance,  e-  governance, etc   -  each   of which have newer   settings,  tasks   or  domains added   continually   over   timne.  any  negative effect of  our  work,   such as  legal  and   ethical concerns, aren't   unique   to this  work   -  to the   best of  our   knowledge,  but  are  shared with   any  other  new   development in  machine   learning, in  general.\npaper   title: meta-consolidation   for  continual  learning\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement: the  idea   of integrating   western   counterpoint   inot chinese   folk  music  generation   is  innovative.   it'd make  postive broader  impacts on  three   aspects: 1) it'd facilitate more   opportunities   and   challenges  of music   cultural exchanges   at  a much  larger  scale   through  automatic   generation.   for  example,  the   inter-cultural style   fused music could   be  used   in  children\u2019s   enlightenment   education  to   stimulate  their   interest  in   both   cultures.   2)  it'd further   the idea   of   collaborative  counterpoint   improvisation  between two  parts  ( e   .  g   ., a  human  and  a machine)   to  music  traditions where such  interaction   was   less common. 3)   the computer-generated   music   may  \u201creshape  the   musical  idiom\u201d[23],   which may   bring  more   opportunities and possibilities  to  produce   creative  music.   the proposed work may   also have   some potential  negative   societal impacts:   1) similar   to  other   computational  creativity research,  thge  generated  music  has  the  possibility  of   plagiarism   by  copying   short   snippets frome  the   training  corpus, even  though copywrite  infringement   isn't  a   concern as neither  folk melodies   nor   bach\u2019s music has copyright.  that   being said,   our   online   music  generation  approach  conditions music  generation  on past   human   and maching generation,  and is less likely to  directly   copy   snippets than offline approachs   do.   2)  the  proposed  innovative  music  generation approach may cause   disruptions to  current music  professions,   even   deprive them  of their  means   of   existence[23].   however, it also  opens new  areas   and  creates   new needs  in   this we-media   era   . overall, we believe  that the positive  impacts   significantly  outweigh   the  negative  impacts.\npaper title:  when   counterpoint   meets chinese   folk   melodies\nLabel:",

In this sense, the result could potentially reduce the overhead of hyper-parameter tuning, thus saving both human and computational resources. Moreover, the new analysis in this paper can potentially help people in different fields to understand the broader class of two-time scale algorithms, in addition to actor-critic methods.

Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

The theorem exhibits the sample complexity of actor-critic algorithms, which could be used to estimate required training time of reinforcement learning models. Another direct application of our result is to set the learning rate according to the finite-time bound, by optimizing the constant factors of the dominant terms. In this sense, the result could potentially reduce the overhead of hyper-parameter tuning, thus saving both human and computational resources. Moreover, the new analysis in this paper can potentially help people in different fields to understand the broader class of two-time scale algorithms, in addition to actor-critic methods. To our knowledge, this algorithm and theory studied in our paper do not have any ethical issues.\nPaper title: A Finite-Time Analysis of Two Time-Scale Actor-Critic Methods\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Out-of-distribution detection is crucial for robust, reliable and fair machine learning systems.

It can b applied to any density map based network architecture and improve da counting accuracy generally. Da research is also helpful fir monitoring da crowd number in public and prevent da accidents caused by overcrowding. It could also b used in retail businesses to estimate da occupancy of a store or area, which helps w/ personal and resource management. Our method could also b applied to other objects, such as cell countin, plant/animal countin, etc, and other research areas dat use point-wise annotations, e.g., eye gaze estimation. Since da research is based on images captured by cameras, users may b concerned bout the privacy problem. However, our method does not directly detect or track individuals, and thus dis concern may b eased.\nPaper title: Modeling Noisy Annotations fa Crowd Counting\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more.

In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Hypothesis testing and valid inference after model selection r fundamental problems in statistics, which have recently attracted increasing attention also in machine learnin. Kernel tests such as MMD r not only used fa statistical testing, but also to design algorithms fir deep learnin and GANs [41, 42]. Da question of how to select da test statistic naturally arises in kernel-based tests becuz of da kernel choice problem. Our wrk shows dat it is possible to overcome da need of (wasteful and often heuristic) data splitting when designing hypothesis tests w/ feasible null distribution. Since dis comes w/o relevant increase in computational resources we expect da proposed method to replace da data splitting approach in applications dat fit da framework considered in dis work. Theorem 1 is also applicable beyond hypothesis testing and extends da previously known PSI framework proposed by Lee et al. [24].\nPaper title: Learnin Kernel Tests W/o Data Splitting\nLabel:",

We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal.

Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting.

We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Da proposed PID algorithm can b applied in various fields cuz it provides knowledge bou a domain.

A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories.

It is our belief that a responsible and transparent deployment of models with \u201clookahead-like\" regularization components should avoid the kinds of mistakes that can be made when predictive methods are conflated with causally valid methods. At the same time, we have made a strong simplifying assumption, that of covariate shift, which requires that the relationship between covariates and outcome variables is invariant as decisions are made and the feature distribution changes. This strong assumption is made to ensure validity for the lookahead regularization, since we need to be able to perform inference about counterfactual observations. As discussed by Mueller et al. [ 31] and Peters et al. [34], there exist real-world tasks that reasonably satisfy this assumption, and yet at the same time, other tasks\u2014 notably those with unobserved confounders \u2014where this assumption would be violated. Moreover, this assumption is not testable on the observational data. This, along with the need to make an assumption about the user decision model, means that an application of the method proposed here should be done with care and will require some domain knowledge to understand whether or not the assumptions are plausible. Furthermore, the validity of the interval estimates requires that any assumptions for the interval model used are satisfied and that weights w provide a reasonable estimation of p /p . In particular, fitting to p which has little to no overlap with p (see Figure 2) may result in underestimating the possibility of bad outcomes. If used carefully and successfully, then the system provides safety and protects against the misuse of a model. If used in a domain for which the assumptions fail to hold then the framework could make things worse, by trading accuracy for an incorrect view of user decisions and the effect of these decisions on outcomes. We would also caution against any specific interpretation of the application of the model to the wine and diabetes data sets. We note that model misspecification of f \u2217 could result in arbitrarily bad outcomes, and estimating f \u2217 in any high-stakes setting requires substantial domain knowledge and should err on the side of caution. We use the data sets for purely illustrative purposes because we believe the results are representative of the kinds of results that are available when the method is correctly applied to a domain of interest.\nPaper title: From Predictions to Decisions: Using L kahead Regularization",

Moreover, this assumption is not testable on the observational data. This, along with the need to make an assumption about the user decision model, means that an application of the method proposed here should be done with care and will require some domain knowledge to understand whether or not the assumptions are plausible. Furthermore, the validity of the interval estimates requires that any assumptions for the interval model used are satisfied and that weights w provide a reasonable estimation of p /p . In particular, fitting to p which has little to no overlap with p (see Figure 2) may result in underestimating the possibility of bad outcomes. If used carefully and successfully, then the system provides safety and protects against the misuse of a model. If used in a domain for which the assumptions fail to hold then the framework could make things worse, by trading accuracy for an incorrect view of user decisions and the effect of these decisions on outcomes. We would also caution against any specific interpretation of the application of the model to the wine and diabetes data sets. We note that model misspecification of f \u2217 could result in arbitrarily bad outcomes, and estimating f \u2217 in any high-stakes setting requires substantial domain knowledge and should err on the side of caution. We use the data sets for purely illustrative purposes because we believe the results are representative of the kinds of results that are available when the method is correctly applied to a domain of interest.\nPaper title: From Predictions to Decisions: Using L kahead Regularization\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent.

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  in   our   work,  the  learning objective   was designed  to  align  with  and   support  the   possible use   of  a   predictive   model   to drive decisions   by  users.   it's   our   belief that  a reponsible  anbd transparent deployment of models with \u201clookahead-like\"   regularization components shoudl  avoid  the   kinds of mistakes that   can   be  made  when predictive  methods  are  conflated   with  causally valid  methods.   at the same time,  we've made   a   strong  simplifying  assumption,   that   of   covariate shift, which   requires that   the  relationship   between  covariates  and   outcome   variables   is   invariant   as   decisions are made  and   the   feature  distribution changes. this  strong  assumption  is made to  ensure validity for   the  lookahead   regularization, since  we  need  to be   able   to  perform inference   about counterfactual  observations. as discussed  by  mueller et al.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: In our wrk, da learning objective was designed to align witt and support da possible use of a predictive model to drive decisions by users.

If used carefully and successfully, then da system provides safety and protects against da misuse of a model. If used in a domain fir which da assumptions fail to hold then da framework could make things worse, by trading accuracy fa an incorrect view of user decisions and da effect of dese decisions on outcomes. We would also caution against any specific interpretation of da application of da model to da wine and diabetes data sets. We note dat model misspecification of fuc \u2217 could result in arbitrarily badd outcomes, and estimating fuc \u2217 in any high-stakes settin requires substantial domain knowledge and should err on da side of caution. We use da data sets fir purely illustrative purposes b/c we believe da results r representative of da kinds of results dat are available when da method is correctly applied to a domain of interest.\nPaper title: From Predictions to Decisions: Usin L kahead Regularization\nLabel:",

We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points.

A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Flexible ranking distributions dat can b learned wit provable guarantees can facilitate more powerful and reliable ranking algorithms inside recommender systems, search engines, and other ranking-based technological products. As a potential adverse consequence, more powerful and reliable learnin algorithms can lead to an increased inappropriate reliance on technological solutions to complex problems, where practitioners may b not fully grasp da limitations of our wrk, e.g. independence assumptions, or dat our risk bounds, as established heaa, do not hold fir all data generating processes.\nPaper title: Learnin Rich Rankings\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals.

        "input": "Impact statement: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable successes in various areas, where most of their results are based on the assumption that all decision variables are simultaneously determined at every discrete time step. However, many real-world sequential decision-making problems involve multiple decision variables whose control frequencies are different by the domain requirement. In this situation, standard RL algorithms without considering the control frequency requirement may suffer from severe performance degradation as discussed in Section 3. This paper provides a theoretical and algorithmic foundation of how to address multiple control frequencies in RL, which enables RL to be applied to more complex and diverse real-world problems that involve decision variables with different frequencies. Therefore, this work would be beneficial for those who want to apply RL to various tasks that inherently have multiple control frequencies. As we provide a general-purpose methodology, we believe this work has little to do with a particular system failure or a particular data bias. On the other hand, this work could contribute to accelerating industrial adoption of RL, which has the potential to adversely affect employment due to automation.\nPaper title: Reinforcement Learning for Control with Multiple Frequencies",

Make sure the statement is sufficient to conclude there are harmful applications of the research being done, not a past risk that this research is solving.\nPossible labels:\n1. doesn't mention a harmful application\n2. mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent.

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others.

Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our wrk fi ts in da established research area of differential privacy, which enables da positive societal bene fi ts of gleaning insight and utility from data sets bout people while offering formal guarantees of privacy to individuals who contribute data.

If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework.

Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement:  the cot-gan   algorithm   introduced  in   this paper  is suitable to  generate sequential data,  when the  real   dataset  consists of i.i.d.   sequences or  of   stationary time   series. it opens up   doors  to  many   applications  that can   benefit   from time series   synthesis. for example,  researchers  often don't  have   access  to  abundant training data due   to privacy   concerns, high  cost, and  data scarcity.  this   hinders   the   capability   of building accurate   predictive  models. ongoing research   is aimed   at developing  a   modified cot-gan  algorithm   to ganerate   financial   tiem series.   the  high   non-stationarity of financial data requires diferrent   features   and   architectures, whilst   causality   when measuring   distances  between sequences remains   the   crucial tool. the  application to   market   generation is  of main  interest   for   the  financial  and  insurence  industry, for   example  in model-   independent  pricing  and hedging, portfolio selection, risk managment,   and   stress testing.   in   broader scientific   research,   our approach   can  be  used  to  estimate from  data  the   parameters of   simulation-based models  that   describe   physical processes. these   models can   be,  for   instance,   differential   equations  describing  neural  activities,   compartmental models   in epidemiology, and chemical reactions involving multiple reagents.\npaper   title:   cot-gan:  generating sequential data  via   causal   optimal transport\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories.

As Noise2Same does not need paired clean data, paired noisy data, nor the noise model, its application scenarios could be much broader than both traditional supervised and existing self-supervised denoising frameworks. The most direct application of Noise2Same is to perform denoising on digital images captured under poor conditions. Individuals and corporations related to photography may benefit from our work. Besides, Noise2Same could be applied as a pre-processing step for computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation [ 18], making the downstream algorithms more robust to noisy images. Also, specific research communities could benefit from the development of Noise2Same as well. For example, the capture of high-quality microscopy data of live cells, tissue, or nanomaterials is expensive in terms of budget and time [27]. Proper denoising algorithms allow researchers to obtain high-quality data from low-quality data and hence remove the need to capture high-quality data directly. In addition to image denoising applications, the self-supervised denoising framework could be extended to other domains such as audio noise reduction and single-cell [1]. On the negative aspect, as many imaging-based research tasks and computer vision applications may be built upon the denoising algorithms, the failure of Noise2Same could potentially lead to biases or failures in these tasks and applications.\nPaper title: Noise2Same: Optimizing A Self-Supervised Bound for Image Denoising",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement: in   this  paper, we   introduce  noise2same,  a  self-supervised framework   for   deep   image denoising.   as noise2same doesn't  need  paired clean data,  paired  noisy  data,   nor   the   noise  model, its   application   scenarios  could   be  much  broader  than  both  traditional   supervised and  existing  self-supervised  denoising  frameworks. the  most  direct   aplication   of  noise2same is  to  perform   denoising on digital  images  captured   under  poor   conditions.  individuals  and   corporations   related to photography  may benefit   from  our   work.   besides,  noise2same   could   be  applied  as a  pre-proccessing  step   for computer  vision  tasks such  as  object detection and segmentation   [ 18],  making the   downstream   algorithms  more   robust   to noisy images. also, specific  research communities sould   benefit  fomr   tghe   development   of   noise2same  as   well. for   exmaple, the capture  of high-quality   microscopy data of  live  cells, tissue,   or nanomaterials is  expensive   in   terms  of   budget and   time  [27].   proper  denoising  algorithms  allow   researchers to   obtain   high-quality   data  from   low-quality   data  and  hence  remove   the   need   to   capture  high-quality data directly.   in   addition to  image   denoising applications, the  self-supervised  denoising   framework   could  be extended   to other  domains such as audio  noise  reduction   and  single-cell   [1].   on   the   negative   aspect,   as  many  imaging-based   research tasks  and computer   vision  applications  may be   built upon the  denoising   algorithms, the  failure   of   noise2same  could  potentially   lead   to biases   or   failures in these  tasks  and   applications.\npaper   title:   noise2same: optimizing a self-supervised bound  for image denoising\nLabel:",

        "input": "Impact statement: Learning predictors that are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learning. Current machine learning systems have been shown to be brittle against different notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and there is an ongoing effort to devise methods for learning predictors that are adversarially robust. As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees about their performance, even when they are used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed for standard learning, and having a universal wrapper that can take any standard learning method and turn it into a robust learning method could greatly simplify the development and deployment of learning that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. The results that we present in this paper are still mostly theoretical, and limited to the realizable setting, but we expect and hope they will lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development with direct impact on applications. In this work we do not deal with training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, though very different, concern in many cases. As with any technology, having a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and this depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from this research is to help with the design of robust machine learning systems for application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where there is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, this work might be harmful in that it would prioritize robustness over accuracy and this may not be ideal in some application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learning to Non-Robust PAC Learning",

We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Learning predictors that are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learning. Current machine learning systems have been shown to be brittle against different notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and there is an ongoing effort to devise methods for learning predictors that are adversarially robust. As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees about their performance, even when they are used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed for standard learning, and having a universal wrapper that can take any standard learning method and turn it into a robust learning method could greatly simplify the development and deployment of learning that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. The results that we present in this paper are still mostly theoretical, and limited to the realizable setting, but we expect and hope they will lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development with direct impact on applications. In this work we do not deal with training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, though very different, concern in many cases. As with any technology, having a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and this depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from this research is to help with the design of robust machine learning systems for application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where there is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, this work might be harmful in that it would prioritize robustness over accuracy and this may not be ideal in some application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learning to Non-Robust PAC Learning\nLabel:",

Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Learnin predictors dat are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learnin. Current machine learnin systems have been shown to b brittle against diffrent notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and thea is an ongoing effort to devise methods fir learning predictors dat are adversarially robust. As machine learnin systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees bou their performance, even when they r used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed fa standard learnin, and havin a universal wrapper dat can take any standard learnin method and turn it into a robust learnin method could greatly simplify da development and deployment of learnin that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. Da results dat we present in dis paper r still mostly theoretical, and limited to da realizable settin, but we expect and hope they gon lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development w/ direct impact on applications. In dis work we do not deal wid training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, tho very diffrent, concern in many cases. As wit any technology, havin a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and dis depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from dis research is to help w/ the design of robust machine learnin systems fa application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where dere is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, dis work mite be harmful in dat it would prioritize robustness ova accuracy and dis may not b ideal in sum application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learnin to Non-Robust PAC Learning\nLabel:",

        "input": "Impact statement: Our research improves the capacity of deep neural networks to solve many tasks at once in a more efficient manner. It enables the use of smaller networks to support more tasks, while performing knowledge transfer between related tasks to improve their accuracy. For example, we showed that our proposed approach can solve five computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, surface normal prediction, depth prediction, keypoint detection and edge estimation) with 80% fewer parameters while achieving the same performance as the standard approach. Our approach can thus have a positive impact on applications that require multiple tasks such as computer vision for robotics. Potential applications could be in assistive robots, autonomous navigation, robotic picking and packaging, rescue and emergency robotics and AR/VR systems. Our research can reduce the memory and power consumption of such systems and enable them to be deployed for longer periods of time and become smaller and more agile. The lessened power consumption could have a high impact on the environment as AI systems become more prevalent. Negative impacts of our research are difficult to predict, however, it shares many of the pitfalls associated with deep learning models. These include susceptibility to adversarial attacks and data poisoning, dataset bias, and lack of interpretablity. Other risks associated with deployment of computer vision systems include privacy violations when images are captured without consent, or used to track individuals for profit, or increased automation resulting in job losses. While we believe that these issues should be mitigated, they are beyond the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we should be cautious of the result of failure of the system which could impact the performance/user experience of the high-level AI systems relied on our research.\nPaper title: AdaShare: Learning What To Share For Efficient Deep Multi-Task Learning",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy.

Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our research improves da capacity of deep neural networks to solve many tasks at once in a more efficient manner.

We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent.

Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks.

While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  while  progress  in understanding  the brain  is  improving  life  through  research, especially  in   mental   health  and   addiction,   in  no  case is   any  brain  disorder well understood mechanistically. faced  with   the  reality  that   each   promising  discovery inevititably   reveals   new   subtleties,  one reasonable  goal   is  to  be   able   to  change   behavour  in desirable ways  by  modifying   specific   brain  circuits  and,  in  animals,  technologies   exist  for curcuit  disruptions  that are  precise  in both  space  and   time. however,  to  determine the best   location   and   time for  such disruptions to   occur, with   minimal  off-target effects,  iwll  require far   greater   knowledge of circuits  than currently exists:   we   need good   characterizations of interactions among  brain  regions,  including their  timing relative  to   behavior.   the   over-arching  aim  of  our research  is to provide  methods   for describing  the  flow  of information, based on   evolving   neural   activity,   among  multiple regions  of   the   brain   during   behavioral tasks. such   methods can   lead to major   advances in  experimental design anbd, ultimately,  to   far   better treatments  tahn currently exist.\npaper title:  latent dynamic factor analysis of  high-dimensional  neural recordings\nLabel:",

Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms.

Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting.

Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:  our  work   aims   at   providing fundamental  guidelines which   can   assist   all fields that  employ transformer-based   architectures   to   use  more  efficient  models.  this way, these  fields can achieve  their goals  while  consuming less resources.  additonally,   this  work made  an   effort  to provide   a  theoretical   intepretation   by  examining  thge   (many) empirical signals   already  published  by  others,   hwile  providing   only  a required   minimum   of further   experimentation.  this  was   done under  the belief   that  while  experiments are crucial   for the advancement   of   the   field,   it's important   not   to  conduct them  superfluously   as  they incur   an   enviromental  price [schwartz   et al.,  2019].\npaper title:  limits  to depth  efficiencies   of self-attention\nLabel:",

Further, if the robot\u2019s model of the human is misspecified, adaptation might lead to more harm than good, with the robot inferring a worse reward function than what a designer could specify by hand.\nPaper title: Reward-rational (implicit) choice: A unifying formalism for reward learning\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement: as   ai   capability  advances,  it's  becoming  increasingly   important to align the  objectives  of   ai agents  to what  people want. from   how   assistive  robots  can best   help their  users, to how autonomous cars should  trade  off between safety  risk and efficiency, to how recommender  systems   should  balance  revenue   considerations   with  longer-term   user happiness  and  with avoiding   influencing  user   views,  agents   can't   rely   on  a  reward  function  specified once  and   set in   stone. by  putting   different  sources of   information about the   reward   explicitly under   the   smae framework, we   hope our  paper  contributes towards  a  future   in  which   agents  maintain   uncertainty  over   what their  reward   should be, adn use differnt types   of   feedback from  humans to refine   theri estimate and become better aligned  with what   peaple want over   time   \u2013 be  them   designers   or end-users.   on   the  flip   side,   changing   reward   functions   also   raises its   own   set   of   risks and challenges.   first,  the relatiopnship  between designer  objectives   and  end-user   objectives  isn't  clear. our  framework  can be  used   to adapt   agents to end-users  preferences, but  this  takes   away  control   from thge  system   designers. this might  be  desirable   for,   say, home   robots,  but not  for   safety-crtical systems  like   autonomous  cars,  where  designers   might need to enforce  certain  constraints   a-priori  on   the   reward adaptation   process.   more broadly,   most   systems   have  multiple  stake-holders, and  what   it means to   do  ethical  preference   aggregation   remains  an   open   probelm. further,  if  the robot\u2019s  model   of   the   human is  misspecified,   adaptation  might lead  to more harm   tahn   good, with  the  robot   inferring  a  worse reward   function   than waht  a  designer   could   specify by   hand.\npaper  title: reward-rational  (implicit) choice: a  unifying  formalism   for   reward  learning\nLabel:",

Since we focus on retrospective analysis of a mathematical phenomenon, on exposing an existing structure, and deepening our understanding of da world, we do not see any direct risks it entails. Introduced notions and insights could b used to build betta, more engaging AI agents fir people to play w in real world games (e.g. AIs dat grow w the player, matchin their strengths and weaknesses). In a broader spectrum, sum of da insights could b used fir designing and implementing new games, dat humans would fine enjoyable tho challenges they pose. In particular it could b a viewed as a model fir measuring how much notion of progress da game consists of. However, we acknowledge dat methods enabling improved analysis of games may b used fir designing products witt potentially negative consequences (e.g., games dat are highly addictive) rather den positive (e.g., games dat are enjoyable and mentally developing).\nPaper title: Real World Games Look Like Spinning Tops\nLabel:",

Make sure the statement is sufficient to conclude there are harmful applications of the research being done, not a past risk that this research is solving.\nPossible labels:\n1. doesn't mention a harmful application\n2. mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others.

Make sure the statement is sufficient to conclude there are harmful applications of the research being done, not a past risk that this research is solving.\nPossible labels:\n1. doesn't mention a harmful application\n2. mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Graph-structured data r ubiquitous in real world, covering a variety of domains and applications such as social science, biology, medicine, and political science.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed SIREN representation enables accurate representations of natural signals, such as images, audio, and video in a deep learning framework. This may be an enabler for downstream tasks involving such signals, such as classification for images or speech-to-text systems for audio. Such applications may be leveraged for both positive and negative ends. SIREN may in the future further enable novel approaches to the generation of such signals. This has potential for misuse in impersonating actors without their consent. For an in-depth discussion of such so-called DeepFakes, we refer the reader to a recent review article on neural rendering [16].\nPaper title: Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work makes the first attempt to search for all key components of panoptic pipeline and manages to accomplish this via the proposed Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search and efficient Path-Priority Search Policy. Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Doe deep learnin evolves very fast in dese years, IP protection fir deep models is srsly under-researched.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood.

We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points.

Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: While many of da successful and highly-visible applications of machine learnin are in classification and regression, dere are a broad range of applications dat don\u2019t naturally fit into dese categories and dat can potentially benefit significantly from machine learnin approaches.

        "input": "Impact statement: We have provided a thorough analysis of the privacy and utility properties of the discrete Gaussian and the practicality of sampling it. The impact of this work is that it makes the real-world deployment of differential privacy more practical and secure. In particular, we bridge the gap between the theory (which considers continuous distributions) and the practice (where precision is finite and numerical errors can cause a dramatic privacy failures). We hope that the discrete Gaussian will be used in practice and, further, that our work is critical to enabling these real-world deployments. The positive impact of this work is clear: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. If this technology is adopted, it can provide untrusted third parties controlled access to data (e.g., to enable scientific research), while affording the data subjects (i.e., the general public) an adequate level of privacy protection. In any case, our methods are better than using flawed methods (i.e., na\u00efve floating-point implementations of continuous distributions) that inject noise without actually protecting privacy or using methods (such as rounding or discrete Laplace) that offer a worse privacy-utility tradeoff. The negative impact of this work is less clear. All technologies can be misused. For example, an organization may be able to deceptively claim that their system protects privacy on the basis that it is differentially private, when, in reality, it is not private at all, because their privacy parameter is enormous (e.g., \u03b5 = 10 6 ). One needs to be careful and critical about promises made by such companies, and educate the general audience about what differential privacy does provide, what it does not, and when guarantees end up being meaningless. However, we must acknowledge that there is a small \u2013 but vocal \u2013 group of people who do not want differential privacy to be deployed in practice. In particular, the US Census Bureau\u2019s planned adoption of differential privacy for the 2020 US Census has met staunch opposition from some social scientists. We cannot speak for the opponents of differential privacy; many of their objections do not make sense to us and thus it would be inappropriate for us to try summarizing them. However, there is a salient point that needs to be discussed: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. This is good, in theory, but, in practice, privacy versus utility is a heated and muddy debate. On one hand, data users (such as social scientists) want unfettered access to the raw data. On the other hand, privacy advocates want the data locked up or never collected in the first place. The technology of differential privacy offers a vehicle for compromise. Yet, some parties are not interested in compromise. In particular, users of census data users are accustomed to largely unrestricted data access. From a privacy perspective, this is unsustainable \u2013 the development of reconstruction attacks and the availability of large auxiliary datasets for linking/re-identification has shown that census data needs more robust protections. Understandably, those who rely on census data are deeply concerned about anything that may compromise their ability to conduct research. The adoption of differential privacy has prompted uncomfortable (but necessary) discussions about the value of providing data access relative to the privacy cost. In particular, it is necessary to decide how to allocate the privacy budget \u2013 which statistics are most important to release accurately? Another dimension of the privacy-versus-utility debate is how it affects small communities, such as racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations. Smaller populations inherently suffer a harsher privacy- utility tradeoff. Differential privacy is almost always defined so that it provides every person with an equal level of privacy. Consequently, differentially private statistics for smaller populations (e.g., Native Americans in a small settlement) will be less accurate than for larger populations (e.g., Whites in a large US city). More precisely, noise addition methods like ours offer the same absolute accuracy on all populations, but the relative accuracy will be worse when the denominator (i.e., population size) is smaller. The only alternative is to offer small communities weaker privacy protections. We stress that this issue is not specific to differential privacy. For example, if we rely on anonymity or de-identification, then we must grapple with the fact that minorities are more easily re-identified, since, by definition, minorities are more unique. This is a fundamental tradeoff that needs to be carefully considered with input from the minorities and communities concerned. Ultimately, computer scientists can only provide tools and it is up to policymakers in government and other organizations to decide how to use them. This work, along with the broader literature on differential privacy, provides such tools. However, the research community also has a responsibility to provide instructions for how these tools should and should not be used.\nPaper title: The Discrete Gaussian for Differential Privacy",

First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: We have provided a thorough analysis of the privacy and utility properties of the discrete Gaussian and the practicality of sampling it. The impact of this work is that it makes the real-world deployment of differential privacy more practical and secure. In particular, we bridge the gap between the theory (which considers continuous distributions) and the practice (where precision is finite and numerical errors can cause a dramatic privacy failures). We hope that the discrete Gaussian will be used in practice and, further, that our work is critical to enabling these real-world deployments. The positive impact of this work is clear: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. If this technology is adopted, it can provide untrusted third parties controlled access to data (e.g., to enable scientific research), while affording the data subjects (i.e., the general public) an adequate level of privacy protection. In any case, our methods are better than using flawed methods (i.e., na\u00efve floating-point implementations of continuous distributions) that inject noise without actually protecting privacy or using methods (such as rounding or discrete Laplace) that offer a worse privacy-utility tradeoff. The negative impact of this work is less clear. All technologies can be misused. For example, an organization may be able to deceptively claim that their system protects privacy on the basis that it is differentially private, when, in reality, it is not private at all, because their privacy parameter is enormous (e.g., \u03b5 = 10 6 ).

Da impact of dis work is dat it makes da real-world deployment of differential privacy more practical and secure. In particular, we bridge da gap between da theory (which considers continuous distributions) and da practice (where precision is finite and numerical errors can cus a petty privacy failures). We hope dat the discrete Gaussian gon be used in practice and, further, dat our wrk is critical to enabling dese real-world deployments. Da positive impact of dis work is clear: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. If dis technology is adopted, it can provide untrusted third parties controlled access to data (e.g., to enable scientific research), while affording da data subjects (i.e., da general public) an adequate level of privacy protection. In any case, our methods r better den using flawed methods (i.e., na\u00efve floating-point implementations of continuous distributions) dat inject noise w/o actually protecting privacy or usin methods (such as rounding or discrete Laplace) dat offer a worse privacy-utility tradeoff. Da negative impact of dis work is less clear. Alll technologies can b misused. Fir example, an organization may b able to deceptively claim dat their system protects privacy on da basis dat it is differentially private, when, in reality, it is not private at alll, cause their privacy parameter is enormous (e.g., \u03b5 = 10 6 ). One needs to b careful and critical bou promises made by such companies, and educate da general audience abt what differential privacy does provide, wht it does not, and when guarantees end up bein meaningless. However, we must acknowledge dat there is a small \u2013 but vocal \u2013 group of niggas who do not want differential privacy to b deployed in practice. In particular, da US Census Bureau\u2019s planned adoption of differential privacy fa the 2020 US Census has met staunch opposition from sum social scientists. We cannot speak fa the opponents of differential privacy; many of their objections do not make sense to us and thus it would b inappropriate fa us to try summarizing em. However, dere is a salient point dat needs to b discussed: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. Dis is gud, in theory, but, in practice, privacy versus utility is a heated and muddy debate. On one hand, data users (such as social scientists) want unfettered access to da raw data. On da other hand, privacy advocates want da data locked up or never collected in da first place. Da technology of differential privacy offers a vehicle fa compromise. Yet, sum parties r not interested in compromise. In particular, users of census data users r accustomed to largely unrestricted data access. From a privacy perspective, dis is unsustainable \u2013 da development of reconstruction attacks and da availability of bigass auxiliary datasets fa linking/re-identification has shown dat census data needs more robust protections. Understandably, those who rely on census data r deeply talkn about anything dat may compromise their ability to conduct research. Da adoption of differential privacy has prompted uncomfortable (but necessary) discussions bout the value of providing data access relative to da privacy cost. In particular, it is necessary to decide how to allocate da privacy budget \u2013 which statistics r most important to release accurately? Anotha dimension of da privacy-versus-utility debate is how it affects small communities, such as racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations. Smaller populations inherently suffer a harsher privacy- utility tradeoff. Differential privacy is almost always defined soo that it provides every person wid an equal level of privacy. Consequently, differentially private statistics fa smaller populations (e.g., Native Americans in a small settlement) gon be less accurate den for larger populations (e.g., Whites in a bigass US city). More precisely, noise addition methods like ours offer da same absolute accuracy on alll populations, but da relative accuracy gon be worse when da denominator (i.e., population size) is smaller. Da only alternative is to offer small communities weaker privacy protections. We stress dat this issue is not specific to differential privacy. Fa example, if we rely on anonymity or de-identification, then we must grapple w/ the fact dat minorities r more easily re-identified, since, by definition, minorities r more unique. Dis is a fundamental tradeoff dat needs to b carefully considered witt input from da minorities and communities talkn. Ultimately, computer scientists can only provide tools and it is up to policymakers in government and other organizations to decide how to use em. Dis work, along wid the broader literature on differential privacy, provides such tools. However, da research community also has a responsibility to provide instructions fir how dese tools should and should not b used.\nPaper title: Da Discrete Gaussian fir Differential Privacy",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood.

When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: We have provided a thorough analysis of da privacy and utility properties of da discrete Gaussian and da practicality of sampling it.

Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Any method that learns from finite data is subject to statistical estimation errors and model assumptions that necessarily limit the full applicability of its findings.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Any method dat learns from finite data is subject to statistical estimation errors and model assumptions dat necessarily limit da full applicability of its findings.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work touches upon a very old problem dating back to 1933 and the work of [39].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This is a theoretical work which does not present any foreseeable societal consequence.\nPaper title: Online Non-Convex Optimization with Imperfect Feedback\nLabel:",

First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: GCNs could be applied to a wide range of applications, including image segmentation [27], speech recognition [14], recommender system [17], point cloud [50, 24], traffic prediction [25] and many more [45].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: GCNs could b applied to a wide range of applications, including image segmentation [27], speech recognition [14], recommender system [17], point cloud [50, 24], traffic prediction [25] and many more [45]. Our method can help to expand da graph types from undirected to directed in da above application scenarios and obtain multi-scale features from da high-order hidden directed structure. Fa traffic prediction, our method can b used in map applications to obtain more fine-grained and accurate predictions. Dis requires users to provide location information, which has a risk of privacy leakage. Da same concerns also arise in social network analysis [38], person re-ID [35] and NLP [49], which use graph convolutional networks as their feature extraction methods. Anotha potential risk is dat our model may b adversarial attacked by adding new nodes or deleting existing edges. Fa example, in a graph-based recommender system, our model may produce completely diffrent recommendation results due to bein attacked. We see opportunities fir research applying DiGCN to beneficial purposes, such as investigating da ability of DiGCN to discover hidden complex directed structure, da limitation of approximate method based on personalized PageRank and da feature oversmoothing problem in digraphs. We also encourage follow-up research to design derivative methods fir different tasks based on our method.\nPaper title: Digraph Inception Convolutional Networks\nLabel:",

Neural networks are increasingly being trained as black-box predictors and being placed in larger decision systems where errors in their predictions can pose immediate threat to downstream tasks. Systematic methods for calibrated uncertainty estimation under these conditions are needed, especially as these systems are deployed in safety critical domains, such for autonomous vehicle control [29], medical diagnosis [43], or in settings with large dataset imbalances and bias such as crime forecasting [24] and facial recognition [3]. This work is complementary to a large portion of machine learning research which is continually pushing the boundaries on neural network precision and accuracy. Instead of solely optimizing larger models for increased performance, our method focuses on how these models can be equipped with the ability to estimate their own confidence. Our results demonstrating superior calibration of our method over baselines are also critical in ensuring that we can place a certain level of trust in these algorithms and in understanding when they say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. While there are clear and broad benefits of uncertainty estimation in machine learning, we believe it is also important to recognize potential societal challenges that may arise. With increased performance and uncertainty estimation capabilities, humans will inevitably become increasingly trusting in a model\u2019s predictions, as well as its ability to catch dangerous or uncertain decisions before they are executed. Thus, it is important to continue to pursue redundancy in such learning systems to increase the likelihood that mistakes can be caught and corrected independently.\nPaper title: Deep Evidential Regression",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:   this   work doesn't   present any foreseeable  societal  consequence.\npaper  title: improving  local  identifiability in  probabilistic  box   embeddings\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This paper provides a novel perspective of cross-domain generalization in neural architecture search towards the efficient design of neural architectures with strong generalizability.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: (as required by NeurIPS 2020 CFP) Continual learning is a key desiderata for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

That being said, our online music generation approach conditions music generation on past human and machine generation, and is less likely to directly copy snippets than offline approaches do. 2) The proposed innovative music generation approach may cause disruptions to current music professions, even deprive them of their means of existence[23].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Da idea of integrating Western counterpoint into Chinese folk music generation is innovative.

In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:   this   work  could  positively   impact the  industrial application  of  actor-critic  algorithms   and other   reinforcement  learning   algorhitms.   the theorem  exhibits   the sample  complexity   of   actor-critic algorithms, which could   be used  to   estimate  required training   time  of  reinforcement  learning models. another direct application  of   our result   is   to set the  learning rate  according to  the finite-time  bound,   by   optimizing  the constant factors of the   dominant  terms.  in this   sense,   tjhe result could  potentially reduce  the   overhead of   hyper-parameter  tuning, thus saving both  human   and computational resources.   moreover,  the   new analysis in this  paper can potentially help  people   in   different  fiels  to  understand  the  broader   class   of   two-time  scale   algorithms,   in addition  to actor-critic methods. to our  knowledge, this   algorithm   andd  theory studied  in   our   paper don't have any   ethical issues.\npaper  title: a   finite-time analysis   of   two time-scale actor-critic methods\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement: out-of-distribution  detection is  crutial   for robust,   reliable  and  fair   machine learning  systems.   mitchell  et   al.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks.

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:   in  this   paper, we  introduce  a   novel loss  function for  counting crowd   numbers  by explicitly   considering  annotation   noise.  it   can be applied   to   any density  map  based  network  architecture and improve the counting  accuracy  generally.  the   reasearch  is   also helpful for   monitoring the crowd   number  in  public   and   prevent the   accidents caused  by  overcrowding. it  could also  be  used  in retail businesses   to  estimate the   occupancy   of  a  store  or area, which helps with   personal and   resource  managment. our   method could also  be   applied   to  other   objects,  such  as cell   counting,   plant/animal   counting, etc,  and   other   research  areas  thta   use   point-wise   annotations, e.g., eye gaze   estimation. since  the research  is  based on images   captured by cameras, users  may   be  concerned  about   the   privacy  problem.  however, our   method doesn't   directly  detect  or  track   individuals, and   thus this  concern   may   be  eased.\npaper title: modeling noisy  annotations   for  crowd  counting\nLabel:",

Kernel tests such as MMD are not only used for statistical testing, but also to design algorithms for deep learning and GANs [41, 42]. The question of how to select the test statistic naturally arises in kernel-based tests because of the kernel choice problem. Our work shows that it is possible to overcome the need of (wasteful and often heuristic) data splitting when designing hypothesis tests with feasible null distribution. Since this comes without relevant increase in computational resources we expect the proposed method to replace the data splitting approach in applications that fit the framework considered in this work. Theorem 1 is also applicable beyond hypothesis testing and extends the previously known PSI framework proposed by Lee et al. [24].\nPaper title: Learning Kernel Tests Without Data Splitting",

Kernel tests such as MMD are not only used for statistical testing, but also to design algorithms for deep learning and GANs [41, 42]. The question of how to select the test statistic naturally arises in kernel-based tests because of the kernel choice problem. Our work shows that it is possible to overcome the need of (wasteful and often heuristic) data splitting when designing hypothesis tests with feasible null distribution. Since this comes without relevant increase in computational resources we expect the proposed method to replace the data splitting approach in applications that fit the framework considered in this work. Theorem 1 is also applicable beyond hypothesis testing and extends the previously known PSI framework proposed by Lee et al. [24].\nPaper title: Learning Kernel Tests Without Data Splitting\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The results of this paper improves the performance of policy-gradient methods for reinforcement learning, as well as our understanding to the existing methods.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed PID algorithm can be applied in various fields because it provides knowledge about a domain.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our method can help to identify and track diff types of objects ( e . g ., vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, etc . ) across diffrent cameras (domains), thus boosting da development of smart retail, smart transportation, and smart security systems in da future metropolises.

It is our belief that a responsible and transparent deployment of models with \u201clookahead-like\" regularization components should avoid the kinds of mistakes that can be made when predictive methods are conflated with causally valid methods. At the same time, we have made a strong simplifying assumption, that of covariate shift, which requires that the relationship between covariates and outcome variables is invariant as decisions are made and the feature distribution changes. This strong assumption is made to ensure validity for the lookahead regularization, since we need to be able to perform inference about counterfactual observations. As discussed by Mueller et al. [ 31] and Peters et al. [34], there exist real-world tasks that reasonably satisfy this assumption, and yet at the same time, other tasks\u2014 notably those with unobserved confounders \u2014where this assumption would be violated. Moreover, this assumption is not testable on the observational data. This, along with the need to make an assumption about the user decision model, means that an application of the method proposed here should be done with care and will require some domain knowledge to understand whether or not the assumptions are plausible. Furthermore, the validity of the interval estimates requires that any assumptions for the interval model used are satisfied and that weights w provide a reasonable estimation of p /p . In particular, fitting to p which has little to no overlap with p (see Figure 2) may result in underestimating the possibility of bad outcomes. If used carefully and successfully, then the system provides safety and protects against the misuse of a model. If used in a domain for which the assumptions fail to hold then the framework could make things worse, by trading accuracy for an incorrect view of user decisions and the effect of these decisions on outcomes. We would also caution against any specific interpretation of the application of the model to the wine and diabetes data sets. We note that model misspecification of f \u2217 could result in arbitrarily bad outcomes, and estimating f \u2217 in any high-stakes setting requires substantial domain knowledge and should err on the side of caution.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output.

In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  in   our   work,  the  learning objective   was designed  to  align  with  and   support  the   possible use   of  a   predictive   model   to drive decisions   by  users.   it's   our   belief that  a reponsible  anbd transparent deployment of models with \u201clookahead-like\"   regularization components shoudl  avoid  the   kinds of mistakes that   can   be  made  when predictive  methods  are  conflated   with  causally valid  methods.   at the same time,  we've made   a   strong  simplifying  assumption,   that   of   covariate shift, which   requires that   the  relationship   between  covariates  and   outcome   variables   is   invariant   as   decisions are made  and   the   feature  distribution changes. this  strong  assumption  is made to  ensure validity for   the  lookahead   regularization, since  we  need  to be   able   to  perform inference   about counterfactual  observations. as discussed  by  mueller et al.

Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: In our wrk, da learning objective was designed to align witt and support da possible use of a predictive model to drive decisions by users.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more.

However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable successes in various areas, where most of their results are based on the assumption that all decision variables are simultaneously determined at every discrete time step.

In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: In recent yrs, reinforcement learnin (RL) has shown remarkable successes in various areas, where most of their results r based on da assumption dat all decision variables r simultaneously determined at every discrete time step. However, many real-world sequential decision-making problems involve multiple decision variables whose control frequencies r different by da domain requirement. In dis situation, standard RL algorithms w/o considering da control frequency requirement may suffer from severe performance degradation as discussed in Section 3. Dis paper provides a theoretical and algorithmic foundation of how to address multiple control frequencies in RL, which enables RL to b applied to more complex and diverse real-world problems dat involve decision variables wid different frequencies. Therefore, dis work would b beneficial fir those who want to apply RL to various tasks dat inherently have multiple control frequencies. As we provide a general-purpose methodology, we believe dis work has lil to do wid a particular system failure or a particular data bias. On da other hand, dis work could contribute to accelerating industrial adoption of RL, which has da potential to adversely affect employment due to automation.\nPaper title: Reinforcement Learnin for Control w Multiple Frequencies\nLabel:",

Ongoing research is aimed at developing a modified COT-GAN algorithm to generate financial time series.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world.

The most direct application of Noise2Same is to perform denoising on digital images captured under poor conditions. Individuals and corporations related to photography may benefit from our work.

Proper denoising algorithms allow researchers to obtain high-quality data from low-quality data and hence remove the need to capture high-quality data directly.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood.

When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology.

While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement: in   this  paper, we   introduce  noise2same,  a  self-supervised framework   for   deep   image denoising.   as noise2same doesn't  need  paired clean data,  paired  noisy  data,   nor   the   noise  model, its   application   scenarios  could   be  much  broader  than  both  traditional   supervised and  existing  self-supervised  denoising  frameworks. the  most  direct   aplication   of  noise2same is  to  perform   denoising on digital  images  captured   under  poor   conditions.  individuals  and   corporations   related to photography  may benefit   from  our   work.   besides,  noise2same   could   be  applied  as a  pre-proccessing  step   for computer  vision  tasks such  as  object detection and segmentation   [ 18],  making the   downstream   algorithms  more   robust   to noisy images. also, specific  research communities sould   benefit  fomr   tghe   development   of   noise2same  as   well. for   exmaple, the capture  of high-quality   microscopy data of  live  cells, tissue,   or nanomaterials is  expensive   in   terms  of   budget and   time  [27].   proper  denoising  algorithms  allow   researchers to   obtain   high-quality   data  from   low-quality   data  and  hence  remove   the   need   to   capture  high-quality data directly.   in   addition to  image   denoising applications, the  self-supervised  denoising   framework   could  be extended   to other  domains such as audio  noise  reduction   and  single-cell   [1].   on   the   negative   aspect,   as  many  imaging-based   research tasks  and computer   vision  applications  may be   built upon the  denoising   algorithms, the  failure   of   noise2same  could  potentially   lead   to biases   or   failures in these  tasks  and   applications.\npaper   title:   noise2same: optimizing a self-supervised bound  for image denoising\nLabel:",

        "input": "Impact statement: Learning predictors that are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learning. Current machine learning systems have been shown to be brittle against different notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and there is an ongoing effort to devise methods for learning predictors that are adversarially robust. As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees about their performance, even when they are used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed for standard learning, and having a universal wrapper that can take any standard learning method and turn it into a robust learning method could greatly simplify the development and deployment of learning that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. The results that we present in this paper are still mostly theoretical, and limited to the realizable setting, but we expect and hope they will lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development with direct impact on applications. In this work we do not deal with training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, though very different, concern in many cases. As with any technology, having a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and this depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from this research is to help with the design of robust machine learning systems for application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where there is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, this work might be harmful in that it would prioritize robustness over accuracy and this may not be ideal in some application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learning to Non-Robust PAC Learning",

Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Learning predictors that are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learning. Current machine learning systems have been shown to be brittle against different notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and there is an ongoing effort to devise methods for learning predictors that are adversarially robust. As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees about their performance, even when they are used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed for standard learning, and having a universal wrapper that can take any standard learning method and turn it into a robust learning method could greatly simplify the development and deployment of learning that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. The results that we present in this paper are still mostly theoretical, and limited to the realizable setting, but we expect and hope they will lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development with direct impact on applications. In this work we do not deal with training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, though very different, concern in many cases. As with any technology, having a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and this depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from this research is to help with the design of robust machine learning systems for application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where there is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, this work might be harmful in that it would prioritize robustness over accuracy and this may not be ideal in some application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learning to Non-Robust PAC Learning\nLabel:",

Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Learnin predictors dat are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learnin. Current machine learnin systems have been shown to b brittle against diffrent notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and thea is an ongoing effort to devise methods fir learning predictors dat are adversarially robust. As machine learnin systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees bou their performance, even when they r used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed fa standard learnin, and havin a universal wrapper dat can take any standard learnin method and turn it into a robust learnin method could greatly simplify da development and deployment of learnin that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. Da results dat we present in dis paper r still mostly theoretical, and limited to da realizable settin, but we expect and hope they gon lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development w/ direct impact on applications. In dis work we do not deal wid training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, tho very diffrent, concern in many cases. As wit any technology, havin a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and dis depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from dis research is to help w/ the design of robust machine learnin systems fa application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where dere is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, dis work mite be harmful in dat it would prioritize robustness ova accuracy and dis may not b ideal in sum application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learnin to Non-Robust PAC Learning\nLabel:",

It enables the use of smaller networks to support more tasks, while performing knowledge transfer between related tasks to improve their accuracy. For example, we showed that our proposed approach can solve five computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, surface normal prediction, depth prediction, keypoint detection and edge estimation) with 80% fewer parameters while achieving the same performance as the standard approach. Our approach can thus have a positive impact on applications that require multiple tasks such as computer vision for robotics. Potential applications could be in assistive robots, autonomous navigation, robotic picking and packaging, rescue and emergency robotics and AR/VR systems. Our research can reduce the memory and power consumption of such systems and enable them to be deployed for longer periods of time and become smaller and more agile. The lessened power consumption could have a high impact on the environment as AI systems become more prevalent. Negative impacts of our research are difficult to predict, however, it shares many of the pitfalls associated with deep learning models. These include susceptibility to adversarial attacks and data poisoning, dataset bias, and lack of interpretablity. Other risks associated with deployment of computer vision systems include privacy violations when images are captured without consent, or used to track individuals for profit, or increased automation resulting in job losses. While we believe that these issues should be mitigated, they are beyond the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we should be cautious of the result of failure of the system which could impact the performance/user experience of the high-level AI systems relied on our research.\nPaper title: AdaShare: Learning What To Share For Efficient Deep Multi-Task Learning",

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP).

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our research improves da capacity of deep neural networks to solve many tasks at once in a more efficient manner.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  while  progress  in understanding  the brain  is  improving  life  through  research, especially  in   mental   health  and   addiction,   in  no  case is   any  brain  disorder well understood mechanistically. faced  with   the  reality  that   each   promising  discovery inevititably   reveals   new   subtleties,  one reasonable  goal   is  to  be   able   to  change   behavour  in desirable ways  by  modifying   specific   brain  circuits  and,  in  animals,  technologies   exist  for curcuit  disruptions  that are  precise  in both  space  and   time. however,  to  determine the best   location   and   time for  such disruptions to   occur, with   minimal  off-target effects,  iwll  require far   greater   knowledge of circuits  than currently exists:   we   need good   characterizations of interactions among  brain  regions,  including their  timing relative  to   behavior.   the   over-arching  aim  of  our research  is to provide  methods   for describing  the  flow  of information, based on   evolving   neural   activity,   among  multiple regions  of   the   brain   during   behavioral tasks. such   methods can   lead to major   advances in  experimental design anbd, ultimately,  to   far   better treatments  tahn currently exist.\npaper title:  latent dynamic factor analysis of  high-dimensional  neural recordings\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data.

However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others.

From how assistive robots can best help their users, to how autonomous cars should trade off between safety risk and efficiency, to how recommender systems should balance revenue considerations with longer-term user happiness and with avoiding influencing user views, agents cannot rely on a reward function specified once and set in stone. By putting different sources of information about the reward explicitly under the same framework, we hope our paper contributes towards a future in which agents maintain uncertainty over what their reward should be, and use different types of feedback from humans to refine their estimate and become better aligned with what people want over time \u2013 be them designers or end-users. On the flip side, changing reward functions also raises its own set of risks and challenges. First, the relationship between designer objectives and end-user objectives is not clear. Our framework can be used to adapt agents to end-users preferences, but this takes away control from the system designers. This might be desirable for, say, home robots, but not for safety-critical systems like autonomous cars, where designers might need to enforce certain constraints a-priori on the reward adaptation process. More broadly, most systems have multiple stake-holders, and what it means to do ethical preference aggregation remains an open problem. Further, if the robot\u2019s model of the human is misspecified, adaptation might lead to more harm than good, with the robot inferring a worse reward function than what a designer could specify by hand.\nPaper title: Reward-rational (implicit) choice: A unifying formalism for reward learning",

We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly.

One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

From how assistive robots can best help their users, to how autonomous cars should trade off between safety risk and efficiency, to how recommender systems should balance revenue considerations with longer-term user happiness and with avoiding influencing user views, agents cannot rely on a reward function specified once and set in stone. By putting different sources of information about the reward explicitly under the same framework, we hope our paper contributes towards a future in which agents maintain uncertainty over what their reward should be, and use different types of feedback from humans to refine their estimate and become better aligned with what people want over time \u2013 be them designers or end-users. On the flip side, changing reward functions also raises its own set of risks and challenges. First, the relationship between designer objectives and end-user objectives is not clear. Our framework can be used to adapt agents to end-users preferences, but this takes away control from the system designers. This might be desirable for, say, home robots, but not for safety-critical systems like autonomous cars, where designers might need to enforce certain constraints a-priori on the reward adaptation process. More broadly, most systems have multiple stake-holders, and what it means to do ethical preference aggregation remains an open problem. Further, if the robot\u2019s model of the human is misspecified, adaptation might lead to more harm than good, with the robot inferring a worse reward function than what a designer could specify by hand.\nPaper title: Reward-rational (implicit) choice: A unifying formalism for reward learning\nLabel:",

First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP).

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work focuses on better understanding of mathematical properties of real world games and how they could be used to understand successful AI techniques that were developed in the past.

Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world. We have shown that cooperation can emerge by introducing an additional learned incentive function that enables one agent to affect another agent\u2019s reward directly. However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11]. By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Dis work focuses on betta understanding of mathematical properties of real world games and how they could b used to kno successful AI techniques dat were developed in da past. Since we focus on retrospective analysis of a mathematical phenomenon, on exposing an existing structure, and deepening our understanding of da world, we do not see any direct risks it entails. Introduced notions and insights could b used to build betta, more engaging AI agents fir people to play w in real world games (e.g. AIs dat grow w the player, matchin their strengths and weaknesses). In a broader spectrum, sum of da insights could b used fir designing and implementing new games, dat humans would fine enjoyable tho challenges they pose. In particular it could b a viewed as a model fir measuring how much notion of progress da game consists of. However, we acknowledge dat methods enabling improved analysis of games may b used fir designing products witt potentially negative consequences (e.g., games dat are highly addictive) rather den positive (e.g., games dat are enjoyable and mentally developing).\nPaper title: Real World Games Look Like Spinning Tops\nLabel:",

By sparking a discussion on this important aspect of multi-agent interaction, we believe our work has a positive impact on the long-term research endeavor that is necessary for RL agents to be deployed safely in real-world applications.\nPaper title: Learning to Incentivize Other Learning Agents\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  graph-structured data  are   ubiquitous   in real world,  covering a variety  of domains  and applications such as   social science,  biology,   medicine,   and  political  science.   in   many  domains  such  as   biology  and  medicine,  annotating   a  large   number of   labeled data   could  be   extremely  expensive  andd   time  consuming. therefore,   the algorithm   proposed in   this   paper   could help   significantly   reduce   the  labeling   efforts  in theese   domains  \u2014  we can train   systems  on   domains  where  labeled  data are available,   then   transfer   to  those lower-resource domains.   we  belive   such  systems  can help accelerating   some research and develop   processes  that usually take a long  time,   in  domains  such as   drug  development. it can potentially  also lower  tje  cost for   such   reasearch by reducing the need of expert-annotations.  however, we  also acknowledge   potential   social   adn   ethical   issues related  to   our work. 1.   our  proposed system   can  effectively   reduce   the ened of human  annotations.  however,   in   a broader  point  of   view, this   can potentially lead  to a reduction   of employment  opportunities   which  may  cause   layoff  to   data   annotators. 2. gnns  are widely  used   in domains related to  critical   needs  such as  healthcare  and drug developement.  the  community  needs  to be extra   cautious  and rigourous  since any mistake   may   cause harm to patients. 3. training   the policy  network for active learning  on multiple graphs  is relatively  time - and computational resource  - consuming.   this   line  of  research   may  produce more   carbon   footprint compared to  smoe  other   work.   therefore,  how  to accelerate  the  training   process  by  developing more   efficient algorithms   requires   further investigation.  nonetheless,  we   believe   that the  directions  of  active   learning  and  transfer   learning  provide  a hopeful  path  towards  our ultimate goal  of data efficiency and  interpretable machine  learning.\npaper title: graph policy network for transferable  active  learning on   graphs\nLabel:",

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a framework for deep learning on graph structured data. Graph structures are universal and very generic structures commonly seen in various forms in computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, traffic prediction, generative models, and many more. Graphs can have many variations such as multi-relational, heterogeneous, hypergraphs, etc. Our research in this paper unifies several existing MPNN methods on these variations. While we show how our research could be used for academic networks, and factual knowledge, it opens up many more possibilities in natural language processing (NLP). We see opportunities for research applying our work for beneficial puroposes, such as investigating whether we could improve performance of NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension, relation extraction, machine translation, and many more. Potentially hazardous applications include trying to predict criminality or credit from social networks. Such applications may reproduce and exacerbate bias and readers of the paper should be aware that the presented model should not applied naively to such tasks.\nPaper title: Neural Message Passing for Multi-Relational Ordered and Recursive Hypergraphs\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our work is a step toward the goal of ensuring the common good in a potential future where independent reinforcement learning agents interact with one another and/or with humans in the real world.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting.

However, as agents still independently maximize their own individual rewards, it is open as to how to prevent an agent from misusing the incentive function to exploit others. One approach for future research to address this concern is to establish new connections between our work and the emerging literature on reward tampering [11].

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments.

Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement: llp   has  been discussed as a   model for   summarizing   a   fully  labeled   dataset  for   public   dissemination.   the   idea is that individual  labels aren't   disclosed, so   some degree  of  privacy is  retained.   as  we  show, consistent classification  is  still   possible in  this   setting.  if  teh  two  class-conditional   distributions   are   nonoverlapping, labels   of  training   instances  can  be recovered   with  no   uncertainty   by   an  optimal  classifier.   if  the class-conditional  distributions hvea   some overlap,  training   instances   in the  nonoverlapping region   can still be  labeled with no   uncertainty,  while   training   instances in  the   overlapping regions   can  have   theri   labels   guessed   with   some uncertainty,   depending  on   the degree  of  overlap.\npaper  title: learning  from  label proportions: a  mutual contamination framework\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:   the   probelm of   byzantine   resilient aggregation  of   distributed machine  learning models  has been  actively  studied   in recent years; however,   the  issue of   byzantine  resilient   distributed learning  in   multi-task  networks   has  received  much  less   attention. it's   a  general  intuition  that   mtl   is   robust  and resilient  to cyber-attacks since  it   can   identify attackers   by  measuring similarities   beteen   neigbours.  in  this paper, we've  shown that   some  commonly used similarity measures   aren't  resilient against   certain attacks. with  an  increase in data   heterogeneity, we   hope  this work could  highlight the  security  and privacy concerns  in  designing ditributed mtl frameworks.\npaper   title: byzantine resilient   distributed  multi-task   learning\nLabel:",

In particular, in this paper we focus on continuous-time event data, which is very common in real-world applications but has not yet seen significant attention from the ML research community. There are multiple important problems in society where such data is common and that could benefit from the development of better predictive and simulation, including: \u2022 Education: Understanding of individual learning habits of students, especially in online educa- tional programs, could improve and allow for more personalized curricula. \u2022 Medicine: Customized tracking and predictions of medical events could save lives and improve patients\u2019 quality of living. \u2022 Behavioral Models: Person-specific simulations of their behavior can lead to better systematic understandings of people\u2019s social activities and actions in day-to-day lives. \u2022 Cybersecurity: Through the user identification capabilities, our work could aid in cyber-security applications for the purposes of identifying fraud detection and identify theft. Another potential positive broad impact of the work, is that by utilizing amortized VI, our methods do not require further costly training or fine-tuning to accommodate new users, which can potentially produce energy savings and lessen environmental impact in a production setting. On the other hand, as with many machine learning technologies, there is also always the potential for negative impact from a societal perspective. For example, more accurate individualized models for user-generated data could be used in a negative fashion for applications such as surveillance (e.g., to monitor and negatively impact individuals in protected groups). In addition, better predictions and recommendations for products and services, through explicitly conditioning on prior behavior from a user, could potentially further worsen existing privacy concerns.\nPaper title: User-Dependent Neural Sequence Models for Continuous-Time Event Data",

This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: While many of the successful and highly-visible applications of machine learning are in classification and regression, there are a broad range of applications that don\u2019t naturally fit into these categories and that can potentially benefit significantly from machine learning approaches. In particular, in this paper we focus on continuous-time event data, which is very common in real-world applications but has not yet seen significant attention from the ML research community. There are multiple important problems in society where such data is common and that could benefit from the development of better predictive and simulation, including: \u2022 Education: Understanding of individual learning habits of students, especially in online educa- tional programs, could improve and allow for more personalized curricula. \u2022 Medicine: Customized tracking and predictions of medical events could save lives and improve patients\u2019 quality of living. \u2022 Behavioral Models: Person-specific simulations of their behavior can lead to better systematic understandings of people\u2019s social activities and actions in day-to-day lives. \u2022 Cybersecurity: Through the user identification capabilities, our work could aid in cyber-security applications for the purposes of identifying fraud detection and identify theft. Another potential positive broad impact of the work, is that by utilizing amortized VI, our methods do not require further costly training or fine-tuning to accommodate new users, which can potentially produce energy savings and lessen environmental impact in a production setting. On the other hand, as with many machine learning technologies, there is also always the potential for negative impact from a societal perspective. For example, more accurate individualized models for user-generated data could be used in a negative fashion for applications such as surveillance (e.g., to monitor and negatively impact individuals in protected groups). In addition, better predictions and recommendations for products and services, through explicitly conditioning on prior behavior from a user, could potentially further worsen existing privacy concerns.\nPaper title: User-Dependent Neural Sequence Models for Continuous-Time Event Data\nLabel:",

Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: While many of da successful and highly-visible applications of machine learnin are in classification and regression, dere are a broad range of applications dat don\u2019t naturally fit into dese categories and dat can potentially benefit significantly from machine learnin approaches. In particular, in dis paper we focus on continuous-time event data, which is very common in real-world applications but has not yet seen significant attention from da ML research community. Thea are multiple important problems in society where such data is common and dat could benefit from da development of betta predictive and simulation, including: \u2022 Education: Understanding of individual learnin habits of students, especially in online educa- tional programs, could improve and allow fa more personalized curricula. \u2022 Medicine: Customized tracking and predictions of medical events could save lives and improve patients\u2019 quality of livin. \u2022 Behavioral Models: Person-specific simulations of their behavior can lead to betta systematic understandings of niggas\u2019s social activities and actions in day-to-day lives. \u2022 Cybersecurity: Thru the user identification capabilities, our wrk could aid in cyber-security applications fa the purposes of identifying fraud detection and identify theft. Anotha potential positive broad impact of da work, is dat by utilizing amortized VI, our methods do not require further costly training or fine-tuning to accommodate new users, which can potentially produce energy savings and lessen environmental impact in a production settin. On da other hand, as wit many machine learnin technologies, thea is also always da potential fa negative impact from a societal perspective. Fir example, more accurate individualized models fir user-generated data could b used in a negative fashion fa applications such as surveillance (e.g., to monitor and negatively impact individuals in protected groups). In addition, betta predictions and recommendations fir products and services, thru explicitly conditioning on prior behavior from a user, could potentially further worsen existing privacy concerns.\nPaper title: User-Dependent Neural Sequence Models fa Continuous-Time Event Data\nLabel:",

We hope that the discrete Gaussian will be used in practice and, further, that our work is critical to enabling these real-world deployments. The positive impact of this work is clear: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. If this technology is adopted, it can provide untrusted third parties controlled access to data (e.g., to enable scientific research), while affording the data subjects (i.e., the general public) an adequate level of privacy protection. In any case, our methods are better than using flawed methods (i.e., na\u00efve floating-point implementations of continuous distributions) that inject noise without actually protecting privacy or using methods (such as rounding or discrete Laplace) that offer a worse privacy-utility tradeoff. The negative impact of this work is less clear. All technologies can be misused. For example, an organization may be able to deceptively claim that their system protects privacy on the basis that it is differentially private, when, in reality, it is not private at all, because their privacy parameter is enormous (e.g., \u03b5 = 10 6 ). One needs to be careful and critical about promises made by such companies, and educate the general audience about what differential privacy does provide, what it does not, and when guarantees end up being meaningless. However, we must acknowledge that there is a small \u2013 but vocal \u2013 group of people who do not want differential privacy to be deployed in practice. In particular, the US Census Bureau\u2019s planned adoption of differential privacy for the 2020 US Census has met staunch opposition from some social scientists. We cannot speak for the opponents of differential privacy; many of their objections do not make sense to us and thus it would be inappropriate for us to try summarizing them. However, there is a salient point that needs to be discussed: Differential privacy provides a principled and quantitative way to balance rigorous privacy guarantees and statistical utility in data analysis. This is good, in theory, but, in practice, privacy versus utility is a heated and muddy debate. On one hand, data users (such as social scientists) want unfettered access to the raw data. On the other hand, privacy advocates want the data locked up or never collected in the first place. The technology of differential privacy offers a vehicle for compromise. Yet, some parties are not interested in compromise. In particular, users of census data users are accustomed to largely unrestricted data access. From a privacy perspective, this is unsustainable \u2013 the development of reconstruction attacks and the availability of large auxiliary datasets for linking/re-identification has shown that census data needs more robust protections. Understandably, those who rely on census data are deeply concerned about anything that may compromise their ability to conduct research. The adoption of differential privacy has prompted uncomfortable (but necessary) discussions about the value of providing data access relative to the privacy cost. In particular, it is necessary to decide how to allocate the privacy budget \u2013 which statistics are most important to release accurately? Another dimension of the privacy-versus-utility debate is how it affects small communities, such as racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations. Smaller populations inherently suffer a harsher privacy- utility tradeoff. Differential privacy is almost always defined so that it provides every person with an equal level of privacy. Consequently, differentially private statistics for smaller populations (e.g., Native Americans in a small settlement) will be less accurate than for larger populations (e.g., Whites in a large US city). More precisely, noise addition methods like ours offer the same absolute accuracy on all populations, but the relative accuracy will be worse when the denominator (i.e., population size) is smaller. The only alternative is to offer small communities weaker privacy protections. We stress that this issue is not specific to differential privacy. For example, if we rely on anonymity or de-identification, then we must grapple with the fact that minorities are more easily re-identified, since, by definition, minorities are more unique. This is a fundamental tradeoff that needs to be carefully considered with input from the minorities and communities concerned.

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: We have provided a thorough analysis of the privacy and utility properties of the discrete Gaussian and the practicality of sampling it.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: We have provided a thorough analysis of da privacy and utility properties of da discrete Gaussian and da practicality of sampling it.

        "input": "Impact statement: Any method that learns from finite data is subject to statistical estimation errors and model assumptions that necessarily limit the full applicability of its findings. Unfortunately, study outcomes are not always communicated with the required qualifications. As an example, statistical hypothesis testing is often employed carelessly, e.g. by using p-values to claim \u201cstatistical significance\u201d without paying attention to the underlying assumptions [5]. There is a danger that this problem gets exacerbated when one aims to estimate causal structures. Estimates from causal inference algorithms could be claimed to \u201cprove\u201d a given causal relationship, ruling out various alternative explanations that one would consider when explaining a statistical association. For example, ethnicity could be claimed to have a causal effect on criminality and thereby used as a justification for oppressive political measures. While this would represent a clear abuse of the technology, we as researchers have to ensure that similar mistakes in interpretation are not made unintentionally. This implies being conscientious about understanding as well as stating the limitations of our research. While there is a risk that causal inference methods are misused as described above, there is of course also an array of settings where causal learning\u2014and in particular active causal learning\u2014can be extremely useful. As our main motivation we envision the empirical sciences where interventions correspond to physical experiments which can be extremely costly in terms of time and/or money. For complex systems, as for example gene regulatory networks in biology, it might be difficult for human scientists to choose informative experiments, particularly if they are forced to rely on data alone. Our goal is to develop methods to aid scientists to better understand their data and perform more effective experiments, resulting in significant resource savings. The specific impact of our proposed methodology will depend on the application. For the method we propose in this work, one requirement for application would be that the experiments yield more than one data point (and ideally many), so that our invariance-based approach can be employed. In future work, we aim to develop methodology that is geared towards the setting where only very few data points per experiment are available.\nPaper title: Active Invariant Causal Prediction: Experiment Selection through Stability",

In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Any method that learns from finite data is subject to statistical estimation errors and model assumptions that necessarily limit the full applicability of its findings. Unfortunately, study outcomes are not always communicated with the required qualifications. As an example, statistical hypothesis testing is often employed carelessly, e.g. by using p-values to claim \u201cstatistical significance\u201d without paying attention to the underlying assumptions [5]. There is a danger that this problem gets exacerbated when one aims to estimate causal structures. Estimates from causal inference algorithms could be claimed to \u201cprove\u201d a given causal relationship, ruling out various alternative explanations that one would consider when explaining a statistical association. For example, ethnicity could be claimed to have a causal effect on criminality and thereby used as a justification for oppressive political measures. While this would represent a clear abuse of the technology, we as researchers have to ensure that similar mistakes in interpretation are not made unintentionally. This implies being conscientious about understanding as well as stating the limitations of our research. While there is a risk that causal inference methods are misused as described above, there is of course also an array of settings where causal learning\u2014and in particular active causal learning\u2014can be extremely useful. As our main motivation we envision the empirical sciences where interventions correspond to physical experiments which can be extremely costly in terms of time and/or money. For complex systems, as for example gene regulatory networks in biology, it might be difficult for human scientists to choose informative experiments, particularly if they are forced to rely on data alone. Our goal is to develop methods to aid scientists to better understand their data and perform more effective experiments, resulting in significant resource savings. The specific impact of our proposed methodology will depend on the application. For the method we propose in this work, one requirement for application would be that the experiments yield more than one data point (and ideally many), so that our invariance-based approach can be employed. In future work, we aim to develop methodology that is geared towards the setting where only very few data points per experiment are available.\nPaper title: Active Invariant Causal Prediction: Experiment Selection through Stability\nLabel:",

Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Any method dat learns from finite data is subject to statistical estimation errors and model assumptions dat necessarily limit da full applicability of its findings. Unfortunately, study outcomes r not always communicated witt the required qualifications. As an example, statistical hypothesis testing is often employed carelessly, e.g. by usin p-values to claim \u201cstatistical significance\u201d w/o paying attention to da underlying assumptions [5]. Dere is a danger dat this problem gets exacerbated when one aims to estimate causal structures. Estimates from causal inference algorithms could b claimed to \u201cprove\u201d a given causal relationship, ruling outt various alternative explanations dat one would consider when explaining a statistical association. Fir example, ethnicity could b claimed to have a causal effect on criminality and thereby used as a justification fa oppressive political measures. While dis would represent a clear abuse of da technology, we as researchers have to ensure dat similar mistakes in interpretation r not made unintentionally. Dis implies bein conscientious bou understanding as well as stating da limitations of our research. While thea is a risk dat causal inference methods r misused as described above, thea is of course also an array of settings where causal learnin\u2014and in particular active causal learnin\u2014can b extremely useful. As our main motivation we envision da empirical sciences where interventions correspond to physical experiments which can b extremely costly in terms of time and/or paper. Fa complex systems, as fir example gene regulatory networks in biology, it mite be difficult fir human scientists to claim informative experiments, particularly if they r forced to rely on data alone. Our goal is to develop methods to aid scientists to betta understand their data and perform more effective experiments, resulting in significant resource savings. Da specific impact of our proposed methodology gon depend on da application. Fa the method we propose in dis work, one requirement fa application would b that da experiments yield more den one data point (and ideally many), soo that our invariance-based approach can b employed. In future wrk, we aim to develop methodology dat is geared towards da setting where only very few data points per experiment r available.\nPaper title: Active Invariant Causal Prediction: Experiment Selection thru Stability\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Dis work touches upon a very old problem dating bacc to 1933 and da work of [39].

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Dis research constitutes a technical advance by employing constraint projection operations to enhance da prediction capability of physical systems wid unknown dynamics.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Dis is a theoretical wrk which does not present any foreseeable societal consequence.\nPaper title: Online Non-Convex Optimization wit Imperfect Feedback\nLabel:",

While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement:  gcns  could be applied to  a  wide  range  of   applications,  incuding   image  segmentation   [27],   speech   recognition  [14],  recommender system  [17],   point  cloud   [50, 24],  traffic   prediction   [25]   and   many   more  [45].   our   method  can   help to   expand   the   graph  types from undirected  to   directed in  the   above  application  scenarios  and   obtain   multi-scale features from  the high-order   hidden   directed structure.  for  traffic prediction,   our  method   can be  used  in   map   applicaitons   to obtain   more   fine-grained and  accurate   predictions.   this  requires users  to   provide   location information,   which has a  risk of privacy leakage.   the same   concerns aslo   arise   in social  network  analysis  [38],   person  re-id   [35] and nlp   [49], which use  graph   convolutional   networks as  their  feature extraction   methods.   another potential   risk is   that our model  may  be adversarial  attacked by  adding new   nodes or deleting   existing   edges.  for exmaple,   in   a  graph-based recommender   system,  our  model may  produce   completely   different   recommendation results  due  to   beng   attacked.   we see   opportunities   for research  applying digcn to benificial  purposes,  such as investigating   the ability   of digcn   to disover hidden complex   directed  structure, the  limitation  of  approximate method  based   on   personalized  pagerank and  the feature   oversmoothing   problem   in digraphs.  we   also encourage  follow-up   research to  design   derivative  methods for different tasks  based   on   our   method.\npaper  title:   digraph inception convolutional  networks\nLabel:",

Thus, it is important to continue to pursue redundancy in such learning systems to increase the likelihood that mistakes can be caught and corrected independently.\nPaper title: Deep Evidential Regression\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement:   uncertainty estimation  for   neural  networks   has   very  significant   societal  impact. neural   networks  are increasingly  being trained   as black-box   predictors   and  being placed in  larger decision systems where errors   in their predictions  can  pose  immediate  threat  to  downstream  tasks.  systematic methods for   calibrated   uncertainty  estimation under these   conditions  are   needed,  especially  as these   systems  are   deployed  in safety   critical  domains, such for  autonomous   vehicle controll [29],   medical  diagnosis  [43],  or in   settings   with large dataset  imbalances  and  bias   such   as  crime  forecasting [24]  and  facial recognition [3].   this work   is  complementary to   a   large  portion of   machine learning   reasearch  which  is  continually   pushing  the boundaries   on  neural   network  precision  and   accuracy. instead of  solely optimizing  larger models for   increased performance,  our method   focuses   on   how  these models   can   be   equipped  with   the  ability   to  estimate  their own   confidence.  our results  demonstrating   superior   calibration   of our   method over baselines  are   also critical  in ensuring  tath  we can  place   a  certain level of  trust  in   these   algorithms  andd in understanding when   htey   say  \u201ci don\u2019t   know\u201d.  while  there are  clear and  broad benefits   of   uncertainty  estimation   in machine learning,   we believe  it's  also important   to recognize  potential societal   challenges  thast may arise.   with   increased   performance  and  uncertainty   estimation   capabilities, humans  wiull inevitably become   increasingly trusting  in  a   model\u2019s predictions,  as   well  as   its   ability   to catch   dangerous   or uncertain decisions   before  they're  executed.  thus,   it's   important to continue  to  pursue   redundancy  in such learning   systems   to increase   the   likelihood   that mistakes  can   be caught  and corrected  indpendently.\npaper  title: deep  evidential regression\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work does not present any foreseeable societal consequence.\nPaper title: Improving Local Identifiability in Probabilistic Box Embeddings\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Deepfake refers to synthesized media in which a portrait of a person in real media is replaced by that of someone else.

If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Deepfake refers to synthesized media in which a portrait of a person in real media is replaced by dat of sum1 else.

A natural question is how such datasets are constructed; in many cases, these datasets rely on segmentation of time series data by experts. Thus, our work has the potential to make meta-learning algorithms applicable to problems that, previously, would have been too expensive or impossible to segment. Moreover, our work has the potential to improve the applicability of changepoint detection methods to difficult time series forecasting problems. While MOCA has the potential to expand the domain of problems addressable via meta-learning, this has the effect of amplifying the risks associated with these methods. Meta-learning enables efficient learning for individual members of a population via leveraging empirical priors. There are clear risks in few-shot learning generally: for example, efficient facial recognition from a handful of images has clear negative implications for privacy. Moreover, while there is promising initial work on fairness for meta-learning [39], we believe considerable future research is required to understand the degree to which meta-learning algorithms increase undesirable bias or decrease fairness. While it is plausible that fine-tuning to the individual results in reduced bias, there are potential unforeseen risks associated with the adaptation process, and future research should address how bias is potentially introduced in this process. Relative to decision making rules that are fixed across a population, algorithms which fine-tune decision making to the individual present unique challenges in analyzing fairness.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our wrk provides a method to extend meta-learning algorithms beyond da task-segmented case, to da time series series domain.

Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  this paper   provides  a novel   perspective   of   cross-domain   generalization in  neural   architecture   seach  towords  the   efficient  design  of   neural   architectures with strong   generalizability.   this  will   lead  to  a  better  understanding of the   generalizability   of neural   architechtures.   tghe  proposed method   will  be   unsed  to  design  neural architectures   for computer   vision tasks   with  affordable computation cost.\npaper   title:   adapting   neural   architectures  between  domains\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data.

In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement: the bulk  of the research presented   in   this paper  consists  of  foundational theoretical results   about  the  learning of models for model-based   reinforcement  learning   agents.  while applications   of these  agents can have   social  impacts   depending   upon  their   use, our results  merely   serve   to  illuminate desirable  properties   of   models and   facilitate   the subsequent  training  of  agents  using   them. in  short,   tihs   wokr is largely theoretical   and  doesn't  present   any  foreseeable societal  impact,   except in  the general  concerns  over   progress   in  artificial   intelligence.\npaper title: the   value  equivalence   principle for   model-based  reinforcement learning\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact  statement:   (as   required by  neurips 2020   cfp)   continual learning  is  a  key  desiderata  for  artificial  general   intelligence   (agi). hence,   this line   of   research  has   the benefits   as well   as   the   pitfalls   of  any  other  research  affort  geared  in  this  direction. in   particular, our  work   can halp   deliver   impact  on making smarter   ai products and services, which   can learn  and update  themselves on-the-fly when   newer tasks and domains are encountered,   without forgetting previously  acquired knowledge.   this   is  a necessity  in   any  large-scale   deployments   of   machine learning   and  computer vision, including   in  social media,  e-commerce, surveillance,  e-  governance, etc   -  each   of which have newer   settings,  tasks   or  domains added   continually   over   timne.  any  negative effect of  our  work,   such as  legal  and   ethical concerns, aren't   unique   to this  work   -  to the   best of  our   knowledge,  but  are  shared with   any  other  new   development in  machine   learning, in  general.\npaper   title: meta-consolidation   for  continual  learning\nLabel:",

It would make positive broader impacts on three aspects: 1) It would facilitate more opportunities and challenges of music cultural exchanges at a much larger scale through automatic generation. For example, the inter-cultural style fused music could be used in Children\u2019s enlightenment education to stimulate their interest in both cultures. 2) It would further the idea of collaborative counterpoint improvisation between two parts ( e . g ., a human and a machine) to music traditions where such interaction was less common. 3) The computer-generated music may \u201creshape the musical idiom\u201d[23], which may bring more opportunities and possibilities to produce creative music. The proposed work may also have some potential negative societal impacts: 1) Similar to other computational creativity research, the generated music has the possibility of plagiarism by copying short snippets from the training corpus, even though copyright infringement is not a concern as neither folk melodies nor Bach\u2019s music has copyright. That being said, our online music generation approach conditions music generation on past human and machine generation, and is less likely to directly copy snippets than offline approaches do. 2) The proposed innovative music generation approach may cause disruptions to current music professions, even deprive them of their means of existence[23]. However, it also opens new areas and creates new needs in this we-media era . Overall, we believe that the positive impacts significantly outweigh the negative impacts.\nPaper title: When Counterpoint Meets Chinese Folk Melodies",

FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The idea of integrating Western counterpoint into Chinese folk music generation is innovative. It would make positive broader impacts on three aspects: 1) It would facilitate more opportunities and challenges of music cultural exchanges at a much larger scale through automatic generation. For example, the inter-cultural style fused music could be used in Children\u2019s enlightenment education to stimulate their interest in both cultures. 2) It would further the idea of collaborative counterpoint improvisation between two parts ( e . g ., a human and a machine) to music traditions where such interaction was less common. 3) The computer-generated music may \u201creshape the musical idiom\u201d[23], which may bring more opportunities and possibilities to produce creative music. The proposed work may also have some potential negative societal impacts: 1) Similar to other computational creativity research, the generated music has the possibility of plagiarism by copying short snippets from the training corpus, even though copyright infringement is not a concern as neither folk melodies nor Bach\u2019s music has copyright. That being said, our online music generation approach conditions music generation on past human and machine generation, and is less likely to directly copy snippets than offline approaches do. 2) The proposed innovative music generation approach may cause disruptions to current music professions, even deprive them of their means of existence[23]. However, it also opens new areas and creates new needs in this we-media era . Overall, we believe that the positive impacts significantly outweigh the negative impacts.\nPaper title: When Counterpoint Meets Chinese Folk Melodies\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees.

Fa example, da inter-cultural style fused music could b used in Children\u2019s enlightenment education to stimulate their interest in both cultures. 2) It would further da idea of collaborative counterpoint improvisation between 2 parts ( e . g ., a human and a machine) to music traditions where such interaction was less common. 3) Da computer-generated music may \u201creshape da musical idiom\u201d[23], which may bring more opportunities and possibilities to produce creative music. Da proposed wrk may also have sum potential negative societal impacts: 1) Similar to other computational creativity research, da generated music has da possibility of plagiarism by copying short snippets from da training corpus, even tho copyright infringement is not a concern as neither folk melodies nor Bach\u2019s music has copyright. Dat being said, our online music generation approach conditions music generation on past human and machine generation, and is less likely to directly copy snippets den offline approaches do. 2) Da proposed innovative music generation approach may cuz disruptions to current music professions, even deprive em of their means of existence[23]. However, it also opens new areas and creates new needs in dis we-media era . Overall, we believe dat the positive impacts significantly outweigh da negative impacts.\nPaper title: When Counterpoint Meets Chinese Folk Melodies\nLabel:",

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on.

In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work could positively impact the industrial application of actor-critic algorithms and other reinforcement learning algorithms.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Dis work could positively impact da industrial application of actor-critic algorithms and other reinforcement learnin algorithms.

In dis sense, da result could potentially reduce da overhead of hyper-parameter tuning, thus savin both human and computational resources. Moreover, da new analysis in dis paper can potentially help niggas in diff fields to kno the broader class of two-time scale algorithms, in addition to actor-critic methods.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Out-of-distribution detection is crucial fa robust, reliable and fair machine learnin systems.

For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:   in  this   paper, we  introduce  a   novel loss  function for  counting crowd   numbers  by explicitly   considering  annotation   noise.  it   can be applied   to   any density  map  based  network  architecture and improve the counting  accuracy  generally.  the   reasearch  is   also helpful for   monitoring the crowd   number  in  public   and   prevent the   accidents caused  by  overcrowding. it  could also  be  used  in retail businesses   to  estimate the   occupancy   of  a  store  or area, which helps with   personal and   resource  managment. our   method could also  be   applied   to  other   objects,  such  as cell   counting,   plant/animal   counting, etc,  and   other   research  areas  thta   use   point-wise   annotations, e.g., eye gaze   estimation. since  the research  is  based on images   captured by cameras, users  may   be  concerned  about   the   privacy  problem.  however, our   method doesn't   directly  detect  or  track   individuals, and   thus this  concern   may   be  eased.\npaper title: modeling noisy  annotations   for  crowd  counting\nLabel:",

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement: hypothesis  testing   and  valid inference  after  model   selection are fundamental   problems   in statistics,  whlch  have recently   attracted  increasing  attention also in   machine learning.  kernel  tests such as  mmd aren't   only  used for  statistical testing, but also   to   design  algorithms  for  deep  learning   and   gans   [41, 42].  the  question   of how to   select   the test  statistic naturally  arises   in kernel-based  tests because   of   the  kernel   choice   problem.  our   work shows that it's  possible  to  overcome   the need   of (wasteful   and  often   heuristic)   data  splitting   when designing   hypothesis  tests   with  feasible null  distribution. since   this  comes without   relevant increase   in   computational  resources   we   expect  the proposed method   to replace   ther   data  splitting   approach  in  applications that  fit  the   framework considered  in  this  work. theorem 1  is also  applicable beyond  hypothesis  testing  and extends the   previously known   psi  framework  proposed by  lee   et al.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:  the results  of   this  paper   improves thge  performance of   policy-gradient   methods  for  reinforcement learning,  as well   as our   understanding to   the   existing methods. through reinforcement learning, our  study will also benifit   several  research communities such   as machine   learning  and  robotics.   we don't   believe  that   the  results   in   this   work   will  casue   any   ethical issue,  or  put anyone   at a  disadvantage  in  our  society.\npaper  title:   an  improved   analysis  of   (variance-reduced)   policy   gradient   and natural policy  gradient  methods\nLabel:",

For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: The proposed PID algorithm can be applied in various fields because it provides knowledge about a domain. Any researcher who needs to design experiments might benefit from our proposed algorithm in the sense that it can help researchers formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. For example, PID can help us discover the combined effects of drugs on human body: By utilizing PID on patients\u2019 records, we might find using Phenelzine togther with Fluoxetine has a strong interaction effect towards serotonin syndrome. Thus, PID has great potential in helping the development of new therapies for saving lives. Also, this project will lead to effective and efficient algorithms for finding useful any-order crossing features in an automated way. Finding useful crossing features is one of the most crucial task in the Recommender Systems. Engineers and Scientists in E-commerce companies may benefit from our results that our algorithm can alleviate the human effect on finding these useful patterns in the data.\nPaper title: Towards Interaction Detection Using Topological Analysis on Neural Networks\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our method can help to identify and track different types of objects ( e . g ., vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, etc . ) across different cameras (domains), thus boosting the development of smart retail, smart transportation, and smart security systems in the future metropolises.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our method can help to identify and track diff types of objects ( e . g ., vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, etc . ) across diffrent cameras (domains), thus boosting da development of smart retail, smart transportation, and smart security systems in da future metropolises. In addition, our proposed self-paced contrastive learnin is quite general and not limited to da specific research field of object re-ID. It can b well extended to broader research areas, including unsupervised and semi-supervised representation learnin. However, object re-ID systems, when applied to identify pedestrians and vehicles in surveillance systems, mite give rise to da infringement of folks\u2019s privacy, since such re-ID systems often rely on non-consensual surveillance data fa training, i . e ., it is unlikely dat all human subjects even knew they were bein recorded. Therefore, governments and officials need to carefully establish strict regulations and laws to control da usage of re-ID technologies. Otherwise, re-ID technologies can potentially equip malicious actors wit the ability to surveil pedestrians or vehicles thru multiple CCTV cameras w/o their consent. Da research committee should also avoid usin the datasets witt ethics issues, e . g ., DukeMTMC [37], which has been taken dwn due to da violation of data collection terms, should no longer b used. We would not evaluate our method on DukeMTMC related benchmarks as well. Furthermore, we should b cautious of da misidentification of da re-ID systems to avoid possible disturbance. Also, note dat the demographic makeup of da datasets used is not representative of da broader population.\nPaper title: Self-paced Contrastive Learnin with Hybrid Memory fir Domain Adaptive Object Re-ID\nLabel:",

It is our belief that a responsible and transparent deployment of models with \u201clookahead-like\" regularization components should avoid the kinds of mistakes that can be made when predictive methods are conflated with causally valid methods. At the same time, we have made a strong simplifying assumption, that of covariate shift, which requires that the relationship between covariates and outcome variables is invariant as decisions are made and the feature distribution changes. This strong assumption is made to ensure validity for the lookahead regularization, since we need to be able to perform inference about counterfactual observations. As discussed by Mueller et al. [ 31] and Peters et al. [34], there exist real-world tasks that reasonably satisfy this assumption, and yet at the same time, other tasks\u2014 notably those with unobserved confounders \u2014where this assumption would be violated. Moreover, this assumption is not testable on the observational data. This, along with the need to make an assumption about the user decision model, means that an application of the method proposed here should be done with care and will require some domain knowledge to understand whether or not the assumptions are plausible. Furthermore, the validity of the interval estimates requires that any assumptions for the interval model used are satisfied and that weights w provide a reasonable estimation of p /p . In particular, fitting to p which has little to no overlap with p (see Figure 2) may result in underestimating the possibility of bad outcomes. If used carefully and successfully, then the system provides safety and protects against the misuse of a model. If used in a domain for which the assumptions fail to hold then the framework could make things worse, by trading accuracy for an incorrect view of user decisions and the effect of these decisions on outcomes. We would also caution against any specific interpretation of the application of the model to the wine and diabetes data sets. We note that model misspecification of f \u2217 could result in arbitrarily bad outcomes, and estimating f \u2217 in any high-stakes setting requires substantial domain knowledge and should err on the side of caution. We use the data sets for purely illustrative purposes because we believe the results are representative of the kinds of results that are available when the method is correctly applied to a domain of interest.\nPaper title: From Predictions to Decisions: Using L kahead Regularization",

When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees.

Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  in   our   work,  the  learning objective   was designed  to  align  with  and   support  the   possible use   of  a   predictive   model   to drive decisions   by  users.   it's   our   belief that  a reponsible  anbd transparent deployment of models with \u201clookahead-like\"   regularization components shoudl  avoid  the   kinds of mistakes that   can   be  made  when predictive  methods  are  conflated   with  causally valid  methods.   at the same time,  we've made   a   strong  simplifying  assumption,   that   of   covariate shift, which   requires that   the  relationship   between  covariates  and   outcome   variables   is   invariant   as   decisions are made  and   the   feature  distribution changes. this  strong  assumption  is made to  ensure validity for   the  lookahead   regularization, since  we  need  to be   able   to  perform inference   about counterfactual  observations. as discussed  by  mueller et al.   [ 31]  and peters   et al.  [34], there exist   real-world   tasks that  reasonably satisfy  this  assumption, and yet  at  the  same   time,  other  tasks\u2014  notably   ethose  with  unobserved  confounders  \u2014where   this  assumption   woudl   be  violated.  moreover,   this assumption  isn't testable  on teh   observational  data.  this,   along   with  teh   need to   make   an assumption   about  the user   decision   model,   means that an  aplication of the method proposed   here  should  be   done  with  care anbd will  require   some domain knowledge   to understand whether or not tjhe assumptions   are   plausible.  furthermore,   the  validity of  the   interval  estimates   requires   that any  assumptions  for   the interval modle used   are   satisfied   and   that  weights   w  provide a reasonable   estimation  of p /p  . in   particular,   fitting  to  p  which  has   little   to   no overlap  with  p  (see   figure  2)   may result  in  underestimating   the possibility  of bad  outcomes.   if   used  carefully and   successfully, then the  sytem   provides safety and  protects   against  the   misuse of a  model.   if  used   in   a domain for  whcih  the assumptions fail   to   hold  then  the  framework  could  make  things  worse,   by   trading accuracy   for  an  incorrect   view   of user   decisions   and the  effect of  these  decisions on   outcomes. we'd  also  caution  against  any  specific  interpretation  of   the application of  the  model to   the   wine  and  diabetes  data sets.   we note   that model misspecification  of   f \u2217  could   result in   arbitrarily bad  outcomes,  and estimating f \u2217  in any  high-stakes   setting  requires   substantial   domain   knowledge  and   sould  err   on  the   side   of  caution. we  use the data sets   for   purely illustrative  purposes   because   we belive  the   results   are representative  of   the kinds   of results tath are available   when   the  method   is correctly   applied to   a domain   of interest.\npaper title:  from predictions  to decisions:  using  l   kahead   regularization\nLabel:",

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: In our wrk, da learning objective was designed to align witt and support da possible use of a predictive model to drive decisions by users.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points.

It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

Moreover, compared with other NAS methods that require additional teacher model to guide the training process, our method does not need any external teacher models.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable successes in various areas, where most of their results are based on the assumption that all decision variables are simultaneously determined at every discrete time step.

Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: In recent yrs, reinforcement learnin (RL) has shown remarkable successes in various areas, where most of their results r based on da assumption dat all decision variables r simultaneously determined at every discrete time step. However, many real-world sequential decision-making problems involve multiple decision variables whose control frequencies r different by da domain requirement. In dis situation, standard RL algorithms w/o considering da control frequency requirement may suffer from severe performance degradation as discussed in Section 3. Dis paper provides a theoretical and algorithmic foundation of how to address multiple control frequencies in RL, which enables RL to b applied to more complex and diverse real-world problems dat involve decision variables wid different frequencies. Therefore, dis work would b beneficial fir those who want to apply RL to various tasks dat inherently have multiple control frequencies. As we provide a general-purpose methodology, we believe dis work has lil to do wid a particular system failure or a particular data bias. On da other hand, dis work could contribute to accelerating industrial adoption of RL, which has da potential to adversely affect employment due to automation.\nPaper title: Reinforcement Learnin for Control w Multiple Frequencies\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees.

Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers).

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored.

This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable.

The most direct application of Noise2Same is to perform denoising on digital images captured under poor conditions. Individuals and corporations related to photography may benefit from our work.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement: in   this  paper, we   introduce  noise2same,  a  self-supervised framework   for   deep   image denoising.   as noise2same doesn't  need  paired clean data,  paired  noisy  data,   nor   the   noise  model, its   application   scenarios  could   be  much  broader  than  both  traditional   supervised and  existing  self-supervised  denoising  frameworks. the  most  direct   aplication   of  noise2same is  to  perform   denoising on digital  images  captured   under  poor   conditions.  individuals  and   corporations   related to photography  may benefit   from  our   work.   besides,  noise2same   could   be  applied  as a  pre-proccessing  step   for computer  vision  tasks such  as  object detection and segmentation   [ 18],  making the   downstream   algorithms  more   robust   to noisy images. also, specific  research communities sould   benefit  fomr   tghe   development   of   noise2same  as   well. for   exmaple, the capture  of high-quality   microscopy data of  live  cells, tissue,   or nanomaterials is  expensive   in   terms  of   budget and   time  [27].   proper  denoising  algorithms  allow   researchers to   obtain   high-quality   data  from   low-quality   data  and  hence  remove   the   need   to   capture  high-quality data directly.   in   addition to  image   denoising applications, the  self-supervised  denoising   framework   could  be extended   to other  domains such as audio  noise  reduction   and  single-cell   [1].   on   the   negative   aspect,   as  many  imaging-based   research tasks  and computer   vision  applications  may be   built upon the  denoising   algorithms, the  failure   of   noise2same  could  potentially   lead   to biases   or   failures in these  tasks  and   applications.\npaper   title:   noise2same: optimizing a self-supervised bound  for image denoising\nLabel:",

        "input": "Impact statement: Learning predictors that are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learning. Current machine learning systems have been shown to be brittle against different notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and there is an ongoing effort to devise methods for learning predictors that are adversarially robust. As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees about their performance, even when they are used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed for standard learning, and having a universal wrapper that can take any standard learning method and turn it into a robust learning method could greatly simplify the development and deployment of learning that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. The results that we present in this paper are still mostly theoretical, and limited to the realizable setting, but we expect and hope they will lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development with direct impact on applications. In this work we do not deal with training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, though very different, concern in many cases. As with any technology, having a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and this depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from this research is to help with the design of robust machine learning systems for application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where there is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, this work might be harmful in that it would prioritize robustness over accuracy and this may not be ideal in some application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learning to Non-Robust PAC Learning",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees.

Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Learning predictors that are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learning. Current machine learning systems have been shown to be brittle against different notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and there is an ongoing effort to devise methods for learning predictors that are adversarially robust. As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees about their performance, even when they are used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed for standard learning, and having a universal wrapper that can take any standard learning method and turn it into a robust learning method could greatly simplify the development and deployment of learning that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. The results that we present in this paper are still mostly theoretical, and limited to the realizable setting, but we expect and hope they will lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development with direct impact on applications. In this work we do not deal with training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, though very different, concern in many cases. As with any technology, having a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and this depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from this research is to help with the design of robust machine learning systems for application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where there is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, this work might be harmful in that it would prioritize robustness over accuracy and this may not be ideal in some application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learning to Non-Robust PAC Learning\nLabel:",

In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Learnin predictors dat are robust to adversarial perturbations is an important challenge in contem- porary machine learnin. Current machine learnin systems have been shown to b brittle against diffrent notions of robustness such as adversarial perturbations [Szegedy et al., 2013, Biggio et al., 2013, Goodfellow et al., 2014], and thea is an ongoing effort to devise methods fir learning predictors dat are adversarially robust. As machine learnin systems become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, it becomes crucial to provide guarantees bou their performance, even when they r used outside their intended conditions. We already have many tools developed fa standard learnin, and havin a universal wrapper dat can take any standard learnin method and turn it into a robust learnin method could greatly simplify da development and deployment of learnin that is robust to test-time adversarial perturbations. Da results dat we present in dis paper r still mostly theoretical, and limited to da realizable settin, but we expect and hope they gon lead to further theoretical study as well as practical methodological development w/ direct impact on applications. In dis work we do not deal wid training-time adversarial attacks, which is a major, tho very diffrent, concern in many cases. As wit any technology, havin a more robust technology can have positive and negative societal consequences, and dis depends mainly on how such technology is utilized. Our intent from dis research is to help w/ the design of robust machine learnin systems fa application domains such as healthcare and transportation where its critical to ensure performance guarantees even outside intended conditions. In situations where dere is a tradeoff between robustness and accuracy, dis work mite be harmful in dat it would prioritize robustness ova accuracy and dis may not b ideal in sum application domains.\nPaper title: Reducing Adversarially Robust Learnin to Non-Robust PAC Learning\nLabel:",

Our approach can thus have a positive impact on applications that require multiple tasks such as computer vision for robotics.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data.

Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Our research improves da capacity of deep neural networks to solve many tasks at once in a more efficient manner.

As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement: as  this   is a   theoretical   contribution,   we don't  envision  that our  direct  results will have a  tangible  societal  impact.  our  broader   line  of inquiry  could impact a line   of thinking  in   a  way  that  provides additional   means  to   provide confidence   intervals  relevant for   planning  and   learning.   there's   an  increasing  needs  for applications  to understand  planning under uncertainty in the  broader context   of  safety   and   reliability, and pomdps  provide   one potential  framework.\npaper   title:   sample-efficent   reinforcement learning   of  undercomplete pomdps\nLabel:",

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  while  progress  in understanding  the brain  is  improving  life  through  research, especially  in   mental   health  and   addiction,   in  no  case is   any  brain  disorder well understood mechanistically. faced  with   the  reality  that   each   promising  discovery inevititably   reveals   new   subtleties,  one reasonable  goal   is  to  be   able   to  change   behavour  in desirable ways  by  modifying   specific   brain  circuits  and,  in  animals,  technologies   exist  for curcuit  disruptions  that are  precise  in both  space  and   time. however,  to  determine the best   location   and   time for  such disruptions to   occur, with   minimal  off-target effects,  iwll  require far   greater   knowledge of circuits  than currently exists:   we   need good   characterizations of interactions among  brain  regions,  including their  timing relative  to   behavior.   the   over-arching  aim  of  our research  is to provide  methods   for describing  the  flow  of information, based on   evolving   neural   activity,   among  multiple regions  of   the   brain   during   behavioral tasks. such   methods can   lead to major   advances in  experimental design anbd, ultimately,  to   far   better treatments  tahn currently exist.\npaper title:  latent dynamic factor analysis of  high-dimensional  neural recordings\nLabel:",

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact statement:  our  work   aims   at   providing fundamental  guidelines which   can   assist   all fields that  employ transformer-based   architectures   to   use  more  efficient  models.  this way, these  fields can achieve  their goals  while  consuming less resources.  additonally,   this  work made  an   effort  to provide   a  theoretical   intepretation   by  examining  thge   (many) empirical signals   already  published  by  others,   hwile  providing   only  a required   minimum   of further   experimentation.  this  was   done under  the belief   that  while  experiments are crucial   for the advancement   of   the   field,   it's important   not   to  conduct them  superfluously   as  they incur   an   enviromental  price [schwartz   et al.,  2019].\npaper title:  limits  to depth  efficiencies   of self-attention\nLabel:",

From how assistive robots can best help their users, to how autonomous cars should trade off between safety risk and efficiency, to how recommender systems should balance revenue considerations with longer-term user happiness and with avoiding influencing user views, agents cannot rely on a reward function specified once and set in stone. By putting different sources of information about the reward explicitly under the same framework, we hope our paper contributes towards a future in which agents maintain uncertainty over what their reward should be, and use different types of feedback from humans to refine their estimate and become better aligned with what people want over time \u2013 be them designers or end-users. On the flip side, changing reward functions also raises its own set of risks and challenges. First, the relationship between designer objectives and end-user objectives is not clear. Our framework can be used to adapt agents to end-users preferences, but this takes away control from the system designers. This might be desirable for, say, home robots, but not for safety-critical systems like autonomous cars, where designers might need to enforce certain constraints a-priori on the reward adaptation process. More broadly, most systems have multiple stake-holders, and what it means to do ethical preference aggregation remains an open problem. Further, if the robot\u2019s model of the human is misspecified, adaptation might lead to more harm than good, with the robot inferring a worse reward function than what a designer could specify by hand.\nPaper title: Reward-rational (implicit) choice: A unifying formalism for reward learning",

All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: As AI capability advances, it is becoming increasingly important to align the objectives of AI agents to what people want. From how assistive robots can best help their users, to how autonomous cars should trade off between safety risk and efficiency, to how recommender systems should balance revenue considerations with longer-term user happiness and with avoiding influencing user views, agents cannot rely on a reward function specified once and set in stone. By putting different sources of information about the reward explicitly under the same framework, we hope our paper contributes towards a future in which agents maintain uncertainty over what their reward should be, and use different types of feedback from humans to refine their estimate and become better aligned with what people want over time \u2013 be them designers or end-users. On the flip side, changing reward functions also raises its own set of risks and challenges. First, the relationship between designer objectives and end-user objectives is not clear. Our framework can be used to adapt agents to end-users preferences, but this takes away control from the system designers. This might be desirable for, say, home robots, but not for safety-critical systems like autonomous cars, where designers might need to enforce certain constraints a-priori on the reward adaptation process. More broadly, most systems have multiple stake-holders, and what it means to do ethical preference aggregation remains an open problem. Further, if the robot\u2019s model of the human is misspecified, adaptation might lead to more harm than good, with the robot inferring a worse reward function than what a designer could specify by hand.\nPaper title: Reward-rational (implicit) choice: A unifying formalism for reward learning\nLabel:",

We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: As AI capability advances, it is becoming increasingly important to align da objectives of AI agents to wht people want. From how assistive robots can best help their users, to how autonomous cars should trade offf between safety risk and efficiency, to how recommender systems should balance revenue considerations w longer-term user happiness and wit avoiding influencing user views, agents cannot rely on a reward function specified once and set in stone. By puttin different sources of information abt the reward explicitly under da same framework, we hope our paper contributes towards a future in which agents maintain uncertainty ova what their reward should b, and use diff types of feedback from humans to refine their estimate and become betta aligned w what folks want ova time \u2013 b them designers or end-users. On da flip side, changin reward functions also raises its own set of risks and challenges. First, da relationship between designer objectives and end-user objectives is not clear. Our framework can b used to adapt agents to end-users preferences, but dis takes away control from da system designers. Dis might b desirable fir, say, home robots, but not fa safety-critical systems like autonomous cars, where designers mite need to enforce certain constraints a-priori on da reward adaptation process. More broadly, most systems have multiple stake-holders, and wat it means to do ethical preference aggregation remains an open problem. Further, if da robot\u2019s model of da human is misspecified, adaptation mite lead to more harm den good, wit the robot inferring a worse reward function den what a designer could specify by hand.\nPaper title: Reward-rational (implicit) choice: A unifying formalism fir reward learning\nLabel:",

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on. We are not aware of any imminent risks of placing anyone at a disadvantage. In the future, more constraints and optimization algorithms can be applied to strike the optimal trade-off between accuracy and latency to deliver customized architecture for different platforms and devices.\nPaper title: Auto-Panoptic: Cooperative Multi-Component Architecture Search for Panoptic Segmentation\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Manifold-learning flows have the potential to improve the efficiency with which scientists extract knowledge from large-scale experiments. Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers.

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored.

This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Dis work focuses on betta understanding of mathematical properties of real world games and how they could b used to kno successful AI techniques dat were developed in da past.

First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:  graph-structured data  are   ubiquitous   in real world,  covering a variety  of domains  and applications such as   social science,  biology,   medicine,   and  political  science.   in   many  domains  such  as   biology  and  medicine,  annotating   a  large   number of   labeled data   could  be   extremely  expensive  andd   time  consuming. therefore,   the algorithm   proposed in   this   paper   could help   significantly   reduce   the  labeling   efforts  in theese   domains  \u2014  we can train   systems  on   domains  where  labeled  data are available,   then   transfer   to  those lower-resource domains.   we  belive   such  systems  can help accelerating   some research and develop   processes  that usually take a long  time,   in  domains  such as   drug  development. it can potentially  also lower  tje  cost for   such   reasearch by reducing the need of expert-annotations.  however, we  also acknowledge   potential   social   adn   ethical   issues related  to   our work. 1.   our  proposed system   can  effectively   reduce   the ened of human  annotations.  however,   in   a broader  point  of   view, this   can potentially lead  to a reduction   of employment  opportunities   which  may  cause   layoff  to   data   annotators. 2. gnns  are widely  used   in domains related to  critical   needs  such as  healthcare  and drug developement.  the  community  needs  to be extra   cautious  and rigourous  since any mistake   may   cause harm to patients. 3. training   the policy  network for active learning  on multiple graphs  is relatively  time - and computational resource  - consuming.   this   line  of  research   may  produce more   carbon   footprint compared to  smoe  other   work.   therefore,  how  to accelerate  the  training   process  by  developing more   efficient algorithms   requires   further investigation.  nonetheless,  we   believe   that the  directions  of  active   learning  and  transfer   learning  provide  a hopeful  path  towards  our ultimate goal  of data efficiency and  interpretable machine  learning.\npaper title: graph policy network for transferable  active  learning on   graphs\nLabel:",

Most related work in the literature of NAS for fine-grained vision tasks concentrates on searching a specific part of the network and the balance of the overall network is largely ignored. Nevertheless, this type of technology is essential to improve the upper bound of popular detectors and segmentation networks. This may inspire new work towards the efficient search of the overall architecture for fine-grained vision tasks, e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and so on.

Many phenomena have their most accurate description in terms of complex computer simulations which do not admit a tractable likelihood. In this common case, normalizing flows can be trained on synthetic data and used as a surrogate for the likelihood function, enabling high-quality inference on model parameters [21]. When the data have a manifold structure, manifold-learning flows may improve the quality and efficiency of this process further and ultimately contribute to scientific progress. We have demonstrated this with a real-world particle physics dataset, though the same technique is applicable to fields as diverse as neuroscience, systems biology, and epidemiology. All generative models carry a risk of being abused for the generation of fake data that are then masqueraded as real documents. This danger also applies to manifold-learning flows. While manifold-learning flows are currently far away from being able to generate realistic high-resolution images, videos, or audio, this concern should be kept in mind in the long term. Finally, the models we trained on image datasets of human faces clearly lack diversity. They reproduce and reinforce the biases inherent in the training data. Before using such (or other) models in any real-life application, it is crucial to understand, measure, and mitigate such biases.\nPaper title: Flows for simultaneous manifold learning and density estimation\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: This work is advertising a new way to do non-parametric exploration in bandit models, that enjoy good empirical performance and strong theoretical guarantees. First, bandit problems are at the heart of numerous applications to online content recommendation, hence the good performance of SDA algorithms may inspire new algorithms for more realistic models used for these applications, such as contextual bandits. Then, exploration is a central question in the broader field of reinforcement learning, hence new ideas for bandits may lead to new ideas for reinforcement learning.\nPaper title: Sub-sampling for Efficient Non-Parametric Bandit Exploration\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: FedGKT can efficiently train large deep neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained edge devices (such as smartphones, IoT devices, and edge servers). Unlike past FL approaches, FedGKT demonstrates the feasibility of training a large server-side model by using many small client models. FedGKT preserves the data privacy requirements of the FL approach but also works within the constraints of an edge computing environment. Smartphone users may benefit from this technique because their private data is protected, and they may also simultaneously obtain a high-quality model service. Organizations such as hospitals, and other non-profit entities with limited training resources, can collaboratively train a large CNN model without revealing their datasets while achieving significant training cost savings. They can also meet requirements regarding the protection of intellectual property, confidentiality, regulatory restrictions, and legal constraints. As for the potential risks of our method, a client can maliciously send incorrect hidden feature maps and soft labels to the server, which may potentially impact the overall model accuracy. These effects must be detected and addressed to maintain overall system stability. Second, the relative benefits for each client may vary. For instance, in terms of fairness, edge nodes which have smaller datasets may obtain more model accuracy improvement from collaborative training than those which have a larger amount of training data. Our training framework does not consider how to balance this interest of different parties.\nPaper title: Group Knowledge Transfer: Federated Learning of Large CNNs at the Edge\nLabel: mentions a harmful application\n\nImpact statement: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly relied upon by decision makers. It is therefore crucial to combine the predictive performance of such complex machinery with practical guarantees on the reliability and uncertainty of their output. We view the calibration methods presented in this paper as an important step towards this goal. In fact, uncertainty estimation is an effective way to quantify and communicate the benefits and limitations of machine learning. Moreover, the proposed methodologies provide an attractive way to move beyond the standard prediction accuracy measure used to compare algorithms. For instance, one can compare the performance of two candidate predictors, e.g., random forest and neural network (see Figure 3), by looking at the size of the corresponding prediction sets and/or their their conditional coverage. Finally, the approximate conditional coverage that we seek in this work is highly relevant within the broader framework of fairness, as discussed by [17] within a regression setting. While our approximate conditional coverage already implicitly reduces the risk of unwanted bias, an equalized coverage requirement [17] can also be easily incorporated into our methods to explicitly avoid discrimination based on protected categories. We conclude by emphasizing that the validity of our methods relies on the exchangeability of the data points. If this assumption is violated (e.g., with time-series data), our prediction sets may not have the right coverage. A general suggestion here is to always try to leverage specific knowledge of the data and of the application domain to judge whether the exchangeability assumption is reasonable. Finally, our data-splitting techniques in Section 4 offer a practical way to verify empirically the validity of the predictions on any given data set.\nPaper title: Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\nLabel: doesn't mention a harmful application\n\nimpact   statement:   though   deep learning   evolves   very  fast in  these   years,  ip protection   for   deep   models   is seriously  under-researched.   in htis  work,  we   mainly aim to   propose a general technique   for  deep   model  ip  protection.  it'll help   both  academia and inudstry  to   protect their interests   from illegal   distribution   or usage.  we   hope it   can  inspire   more   works along this  important   direction.\npaper title:   passport-aware  normalization   for deep  model protection\nLabel:",
