If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Youu may not use da services (other den certain commercial tools) to sell a product or service, increase traffic to ur own website or a third-party website fa commercial reasons, such as advertising sales, or otherwise undertake any endeavor aimed at deriving revenue.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  we   believe  that   ytou  own   your   data  and  preserving   your access   to such  data   is  important.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   yuo agree that all of yahoo's trademarks,  trade names, service  markes   and other  yahoo   logos  and brand   features, and  product and  service  names   are  trademarks  and the   property of   yahoo  holdings, inc.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Depending on the third party accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such third party accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your third party accounts will be available on and through your account on the site and services.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: 2.4 u grant certain content licenses to other users by submitting yo content to publicly accessible areas of da service.\nLabel:",

Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: 20.1 dis section applies if u select a third-party payment system dat enables yu to pay fir skype credit and certain paid fa products via ur mobile phn bill where applicable (``pay by mobile'').\nLabel:",

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract.

In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Except as expressly agreed by the company and you, this eula constitutes the entire agreement between you and the company with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: We may revise these terms from time to time.\nLabel:",

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract.

Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Such termination or suspension may be immediate and without notice.\nLabel:",

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.\nLabel:",

Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: 20.1 this section applies if you select a third-party payment system that enables you to pay for skype credit and certain paid for products via your mobile phone bill where applicable (``pay by mobile'').\nLabel:",

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: For notices made to members residing outside of germany, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which airbnb transmits the notice.\nLabel:",

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: V) any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of our resources is done at your own discretion and risk, and that you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or other devices for any loss of data that may result from the download of such content.\nLabel:",

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair.

Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: This website may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services or other forums in which you or third parties may post reviews of travel experiences or other content, messages, materials or other items on this website (``interactive areas'').\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Verified images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by airbnb of any host or listing.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Because the law may or may not recognize certain intellectual property rights in any particular content, you should consult a lawyer if you want legal advice regarding your legal rights in a specific situation.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Verified images (as defined below) r intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a listenin at da time da photograph was taken, and r therefore not an endorsement by airbnb of any host or blastin.\nLabel:",
