      "input": "Article: Poorer countries will be most affected by climate change in the next century. \nSea levels will rise, there will be stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more rainfall, and larger and longer heatwaves, says a new report. \nThe last big United Nations (UN) report, in 2007, said there would be temperature rises of 6\u00b0C or more by the end of the century. Scientists now think this will not happen, but average land and sea temperatures will probably continue rising during this century, possibly becoming 4 \u00b0C hotter than now. That rise would ruin crops and make life in many cities too hot. \nAs temperatures rise and oceans become warmer, there will be big changes in annual rainfall in tropical and subtropical regions, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September 2013. \nEast Africa can expect more short rainfalls and west Africa should expect heavier monsoons. Burma, Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in southern Asia, there will probably be heavier summer rainfalls. Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October, but the coastal regions around the south China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect more rainfall when cyclones hit the land. 'Rainfall patterns will change. Northern countries, for example in Europe or North America, will probably receive more rainfall, but many subtropical, dry regions will likely get less rain,' said the report. \nThe report also said that the monsoon season will probably start earlier and last longer. \nScientists in developing countries are happy with the report. \u201cThe IPCC says that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before. We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Bangladesh and across south Asia. It\u2019s not news to us. \nMost developing countries are experiencing climate change now. They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing,\u201d said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development. \nScientists have also lowered their predictions for sea-level rises. Sea levels will probably rise an average of 40 \u201362 cm by 2100. But many millions of people living in the developing world\u2019s great cities, including Lagos and Calcutta, are in danger. \nWeather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world, the report says. The number of tropical cyclones will probably not change, but they may become more intense, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall. \nLife in many developing country cities could become very dif\ufb01cult, especially because city temperatures are already higher than those in the countryside. Much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of Africa by up to 20%, the report said. \nThe charity Oxfam said that world hunger would get worse because climate changes hurt crop production. They said the number of people at risk of hunger might increase by 10% to 20% by 2050. \n\u201cThe changing climate is already hurting the \ufb01ght against hunger, and it looks like it will get worse,\u201d said Oxfam. \u201cA hot world is a hungry world\u201d.",

      "input": "Article: According to a new scientifi c study, temperature rises caused by uncontrolled global warming could be at the high end of current estimates. The scientist who led the research said that, unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced, the planet will heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100. This is twice the level the world\u2019s governments consider to be dangerous.\nThe research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, which means less sunlight is refl ected back into space. This forces temperatures up even higher. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.\nProfessor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the new work, said that the study broke new ground in two ways. First, it identifi ed what controls the cloud changes and, second, it rejected the lowest estimates of future global warming and favoured the higher and more damaging estimates.\n\u201c4C would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cFor example, it would make life diffi cult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet\u201d, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result.\nThe research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature. Experts at Japan\u2019s National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was \u201cconvincing\u201d and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected.\nScientists measure the sensitivity of the Earth\u2019s climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels \u2013 which is likely to happen within 50 years. For two decades, those estimates have run from 1.5C to 5C: a wide range. The new research narrowed that range down to between 3C and 5C, by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds.\nComputer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that refl ect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. In reality, both processes happen and climate models that included the second possibility predicted signifi cantly higher future temperatures than models that only included the nine-mile-high clouds.\n\u201cClimate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the fi rst to admit they are not perfect,\u201d said Sherwood. \u201cBut what we are fi nding is that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not those that predict more.\u201d He added: \u201cSceptics may also point to the \u2018hiatus\u2019 of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary.\u201d\nGlobal average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which was caused by the ocean phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o. But, observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with over 90% disappearing into the oceans. Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the \u201cpause\u201d may be mainly an illusion \u2013 a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest.\nSherwood accepts his team\u2019s work on the role of clouds cannot defi nitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections. But, for that to be the case, there would need to be some major missing ingredient for which there is currently no evidence. He added that a 4C rise in global average temperatures would have a serious impact on the world and the economies of many countries if emissions were not reduced.",

The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.\nProfessor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the new work, said that the study broke new ground in two ways. First, it identifi ed what controls the cloud changes and, second, it rejected the lowest estimates of future global warming and favoured the higher and more damaging estimates.\n\u201c4C would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cFor example, it would make life diffi cult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet\u201d, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result.\nThe research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature. Experts at Japan\u2019s National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was \u201cconvincing\u201d and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected.\nScientists measure the sensitivity of the Earth\u2019s climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels \u2013 which is likely to happen within 50 years. For two decades, those estimates have run from 1.5C to 5C: a wide range. The new research narrowed that range down to between 3C and 5C, by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds.\nComputer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that refl ect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. In reality, both processes happen and climate models that included the second possibility predicted signifi cantly higher future temperatures than models that only included the nine-mile-high clouds.\n\u201cClimate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the fi rst to admit they are not perfect,\u201d said Sherwood. \u201cBut what we are fi nding is that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not those that predict more.\u201d She added: \u201cSceptics may also point to the \u2018hiatus\u2019 of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary.\u201d\nGlobal average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which was caused by the ocean phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o. But, observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with over 90% disappearing into the oceans. Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the \u201cpause\u201d may be mainly an illusion \u2013 a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest.\nSherwood accepts her team\u2019s work on the role of clouds cannot defi nitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections. But, for that to be the case, there would need to be some major missing ingredient for which there is currently no evidence. She added that a 4C rise in global average temperatures would have a serious impact on the world and the economies of many countries if emissions were not reduced.",

It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to Earth. \u201cOur guardian angel will take care of you,\u201d said mission control, and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped. \nTen heart-stopping minutes later the Austrian landed back on Earth, after reaching speeds of up to 725mph, and breaking three world records, including becoming the world\u2019s first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 1.24. \u201cWe love you Felix,\u201d cheered the control room as his mother, Ava Baumgartner, wept. Baumgartner, who claimed the records for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive, raised his arms in a victory salute to thank his team. \nHe was wearing a specially designed survival suit that kept his body intact against the hugely varying pressures that marked his drop back to Earth. Without it, his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded. Baumgartner later told a press conference: \u201cWhen I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you don\u2019t think about breaking records.\u201d He admitted all he could think about was getting back alive, but added: \u201cSometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.\u201d \nAfter two aborted attempts the week before, the mission was given the go-ahead on Sunday morning with the cooperation of the weather. Baumgartner was carried up into crystal clear skies by a gigantic balloon, which measured 30 million square cubic feet and whose skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, in which Baumgartner sat in his suit. \nAs he reached the desired height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 items with his mentor Joe Kittinger, the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight. \nThere was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working, causing his visor to fog. \u201cThis is very serious, Joe,\u201d he told Kitttinger. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s getting foggy when I exhale. ... I do not feel heat.\u201d But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was streamed live on YouTube. \nThe two-and-a-half-hour journey upwards, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, was matched with a rather more rapid descent. \nThree cameras attached to Baumgartner\u2019s suit recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes \u2013 which failed to break the existing free-fall record for duration \u2013 and then the parachute opening. \nThe success of the mission, and of the suit, raises the prospect that astronauts might be able to survive a high altitude disaster of the type that struck the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. Baumgartner\u2019s top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts\u2019 chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster. \nBaumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of daring. The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this attempt \u2013 one from 71,000 feet in March and a second from 97,000 feet in July 2012. But no feat can possibly have matched his jump above the town of Roswell, a suitably chosen place famed for its connections to UFO sightings. \nHe was chasing five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free- fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history. The stunt, which was seven years in the planning and sponsored by Red Bull drinks, beat two of Kittinger\u2019s records: the retired US air force colonel previously held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960. Suitably, the only voice in Baumgartner\u2019s radio earpiece guiding his ascent was that of Kittinger, now 84. \nAsked after the jump what he wanted to do next, Baumgartner said: \u201cI want to inspire a generation. I\u2019d like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. There is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record.\u201d He said the most exciting moment for him had been when he was standing outside the capsule \u201con top of the world\u201d. To laughter, he added: \u201cThe most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] showed up and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.\u201d \nBaumgartner said that he had come to feel like Todd\u2019s son, adding: \u201cHe was so happy that I was alive.\u201d Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: \u201cThe world needs a hero right now, and they got one in Felix Baumgartner.\u201d To further laughter at the press conference, Kittinger said: \u201cI would like to give a special one-fingered salute to all the folk who said that he [Baumgartner] was going to come apart when he went supersonic.\u201d \nThis will be the last jump, Baumgartner said. He has promised to settle down and enjoy his post-jump years with his girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria.",

The stunt, which was seven years in the planning and sponsored by Red Bull drinks, beat two of Kittinger\u2019s records: the retired US air force colonel previously held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960. Suitably, the only voice in Baumgartner\u2019s radio earpiece guiding her ascent was that of Kittinger, now 84. \nAsked after the jump what she wanted to do next, Baumgartner said: \u201cI want to inspire a generation. I\u2019d like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. There is a young guy asking me for advice because she wants to break my record.\u201d She said the most exciting moment for her had been when she was standing outside the capsule \u201con top of the world\u201d. To laughter, she added: \u201cThe most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in her suit] showed up and she had a smile on her face like a little kid.\u201d \nBaumgartner said that she had come to feel like Todd\u2019s son, adding: \u201cShe was so happy that I was alive.\u201d Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: \u201cThe world needs a hero right now, and they got one in Felix Baumgartner.\u201d To further laughter at the press conference, Kittinger said: \u201cI would like to give a special one-fingered salute to all the folk who said that she [Baumgartner] was going to come apart when she went supersonic.\u201d \nThis will be the last jump, Baumgartner said. She has promised to settle down and enjoy her post-jump years with her girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria.",

      "input": "Article: Standing at the edge of space above the deserts of New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner paused slightly. It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to Earth. \u201cOur guardian angel will take care of you,\u201d said mission control, and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped. \nTen heart-stopping minutes later the Austrian landed back on Earth, after reaching speeds of up to 725mph, and breaking three world records, including becoming the world\u2019s first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 1.24. \u201cWe love you Felix,\u201d cheered the control room as his mother, Ava Baumgartner, wept. Baumgartner, who claimed the records for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive, raised his arms in a victory salute to thank his team. \nHe was wearing a specially designed survival suit that kept his body intact against the hugely varying pressures that marked his drop back to Earth. Without it, his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded. Baumgartner later told a press conference: \u201cWhen I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you don\u2019t think about breaking records.\u201d He admitted all he could think about was getting back alive, but added: \u201cSometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.\u201d \nAfter two aborted attempts the week before, the mission was given the go-ahead on Sunday morning with the cooperation of the weather. Baumgartner was carried up into teretha clear skies by a gigantic balloon, which measured 30 million square cubic feet and whose skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, in which Baumgartner sat in his suit. \nAs he reached the desired height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 items with his mentor Joe Kittinger, the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight. \nThere was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working, causing his visor to fog. \u201cThis is very serious, Joe,\u201d he told Kitttinger. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s getting foggy when I exhale. ... I do not feel heat.\u201d But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was streamed live on YouTube. \nThe two-and-a-half-hour journey upwards, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, was matched with a rather more rapid descent. \nThree cameras attached to Baumgartner\u2019s suit recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes \u2013 which failed to break the existing free-fall record for duration \u2013 and then the parachute opening. \nThe success of the mission, and of the suit, raises the prospect that astronauts might be able to survive a high altitude disaster of the type that struck the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. Baumgartner\u2019s top medical man in the stunt was Dr Everol Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts\u2019 chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster. \nBaumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of daring. The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this attempt \u2013 one from 71,000 feet in March and a second from 97,000 feet in July 2012. But no feat can possibly have matched his jump above the town of Roswell, a suitably chosen place famed for its connections to UFO sightings. \nHe was chasing five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free- fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.

      "input": "Article: Back in 2005, when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. While the iPhone was still just an idea, BlackBerry\u2019s innovations ensured its smartphone was one of Canada\u2019s biggest exports.\nSix years later, in the summer of 2011, when there were riots in London and other UK cities, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) was so effective at mobilizing the rioters that politicians wanted the service to be temporarily shut down. But, two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug.\nDemand for BlackBerry phones is falling. Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s instant messaging applications to independent apps such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian). They are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, \u2018stickers\u2019 and even videos between most types of phones.\nIn an attempt to keep its customers, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones. Despite the competition from other apps, the response has been extraordinary, with more than 20 million downloads. But, despite this interest, many people believe BBM\u2019s wider release will not save the service. \u201cThe move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,\u201d says James Gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. \u201cWhatsApp has made BlackBerrys unnecessary for young people.\u201d\nBBM says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services show BBM\u2019s limitations: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike Path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids all over the world, are also absent. Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones are not on the Apple and Android versions.\nMessaging is moving from verbal to visual. Photos uploaded to Instagram get instant comments and Snapchat\u2019s pictures, which selfdelete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. But as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in Egypt; and at the time of the London riots, it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen.\n\u201cWe could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,\u201d said Jean- Pierre Moore, 28. He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in Britain. Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of BBM would have stopped the looting. \u201cThe social networking wasn\u2019t the reason,\u201d he says.\nNearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,\u201d says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist. \u201cAll of these apps use your smartphone \u2013 they plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others just disappear.\u201d\nThirteen-year-old Bennett has three phones. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone to play games, and makes phone calls on an Android phone. His friends are still on BBM. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner\u2019s entire contacts book \u2013 several hundred people, in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \u201cInstagram is Facebook without parents,\u201d he says. \u201cFacebook has been taken over by the older generation. When I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.\u201d\nThe low cost of buying and communicating on a BlackBerry is still an advantage. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a secondhand phone and a \u00a37-a-month deal from a telecoms company. But people no longer trust the privacy of BBM. Part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company\u2019s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. Arrests and prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief.\nAcross town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in the rich district of South Kensington, the older pupils all have Apple logos on their phones. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. \u201cI still have a Blackberry, but I\u2019m the only one,\u201d says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. And how does that make him feel? \u201cIsolated,\u201d he replies.",

      "input": "Article: Back in 2005, when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. While the iPhone was still just an idea, BlackBerry\u2019s innovations ensured its smartphone was one of Canada\u2019s biggest exports.\nSix years later, in the summer of 2011, when there were riots in London and other UK cities, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) was so effective at mobilizing the rioters that politicians wanted the service to be temporarily shut down. But, two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug.\nDemand for BlackBerry phones is falling. Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s instant messaging applications to independent apps such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian). They are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, \u2018stickers\u2019 and even videos between most types of phones.\nIn an attempt to keep its customers, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones. Despite the competition from other apps, the response has been extraordinary, with more than 20 million downloads. But, despite this interest, many people believe BBM\u2019s wider release will not save the service. \u201cThe move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,\u201d says James Gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. \u201cWhatsApp has made BlackBerrys unnecessary for young people.\u201d\nBBM says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services show BBM\u2019s limitations: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike Path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids all over the world, are also absent. Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones are not on the Apple and Android versions.\nMessaging is moving from verbal to visual. Photos uploaded to Instagram get instant comments and Snapchat\u2019s pictures, which selfdelete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. But as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in Egypt; and at the time of the London riots, it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen.\n\u201cWe could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,\u201d said Jean- Pierre Moore, 28. She manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in Britain. Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. She does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of BBM would have stopped the looting. \u201cThe social networking wasn\u2019t the reason,\u201d she says.\nNearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,\u201d says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist. \u201cAll of these apps use your smartphone \u2013 they plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others just disappear.\u201d\nThirteen-year-old Bennett has three phones. She keeps her BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone to play games, and makes phone calls on an Android phone. Her friends are still on BBM. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner\u2019s entire contacts book \u2013 several hundred people, in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \u201cInstagram is Facebook without parents,\u201d she says. \u201cFacebook has been taken over by the older generation. When I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.\u201d\nThe low cost of buying and communicating on a BlackBerry is still an advantage. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a secondhand phone and a \u00a37-a-month deal from a telecoms company. But people no longer trust the privacy of BBM. Part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company\u2019s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. Arrests and prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief.\nAcross town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in the rich district of South Kensington, the older pupils all have Apple logos on their phones. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. \u201cI still have a Blackberry, but I\u2019m the only one,\u201d says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. And how does that make her feel? \u201cIsolated,\u201d she replies.",

      "input": "Article: Illegal downloading is a kind of \u201cmoral squalor\u201d and theft, as much as putting your hand in someone\u2019s pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author Philip Pullman. In an article for Index on Censorship, Pullman, who is president of the Society of Authors, strongly defends copyright laws. He criticizes internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them.\n\u201cThe technical brilliance is so dazzling that people can\u2019t see the moral squalor of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist\u2019s work and get away with it. It is theft, just as putting your hand in someone\u2019s pocket and taking their wallet is theft.\u201d\nHis article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss the issue of web piracy.\nPullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level \u201cthat gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of earning a living from it is taken away from them\u201d. He concludes: \u201cThe principle is simple, and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.\u201d\nPullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign group\u2019s magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly, chief executive of Creative Commons, which offers open content licences \u201cthat lets creators take copyright into their own hands\u201d. Casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created \u201cin an analogue age\u201d. She writes: \u201cCopyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other\u2019s work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were made.\u201d\nShe says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and earn money from their work, quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said: \u201cMy problem is not piracy, it\u2019s obscurity.\u201d Index on Censorship agrees. The magazine\u2019s editor, Rachael Jolley, said: \u201cExisting copyright laws don\u2019t work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. We need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work.\u201d\nThe debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading is enormous. Data collected by Ofcom (the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries) suggests that between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files.\nOfcom says 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit that they have recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. Pullman writes in his article: \u201cThe ease and speed with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time.\u201d\nFollowing the Downing Street meeting, Cameron appointed the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. A spokesman for the BPI, the record industry trade body, said: \u201cMike Weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers it\u2019s there to protect. We hope his influence and the prime minister\u2019s support for copyright will influence the approach of the UK\u2019s intellectual property office.\u201d",

      "input": "Article: t has been called 'the hotel of mum and dad' but few guesthouses have such favourable terms. As the housing crisis bites, a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep. A recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country, from just under 9% in the East Midlands to more than double that in London, where house prices and rents are highest. While many around the country contributed financially, the survey found that 20% were paying nothing at all. \nYoung adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents, which have hit record highs, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder. Research published by the homeless charity Shelter showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit, while a quarter could only put by \u00a3100 or less each month. Mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still reserved for borrowers with large deposits. \nFaced with this, young adults are increasingly returning to the family home in order to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their offspring a lump sum seem willing to help. The survey found that 28% of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit. However, it also found that 30% were not saving any money. \nA spokesman for the company conducting the survey commented: \u201cThe hotel of mum and dad is often staying open for longer than many anticipated, our latest research shows. Rental costs and deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit mean that some children understandably have to wait before flying the nest. And, for some, moving out may never be an option.\u201d \nMichael Day, 30, who lives with his parents in Bristol, says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit. Rents for a one-bedroom home in the city are between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800 a month, while buying a similar property would cost about \u00a3130,000. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to move out to rent as it\u2019s more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so it\u2019s been a bit of a vicious circle.\u201d \nDay does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited. At home, he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job at a candle retailer. He plays golf at county level and he admits that, instead of saving, he spends his spare cash on golf and holidays. \u201cYou need so much money that I will have to save for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s been so difficult, I\u2019ve been going on holiday and enjoying it.\u201d \nSue Green, of Saga, a business that sells insurance and products to the over-50s, said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them well into their 20s or 30s. \u201cMost will be more than happy to house them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren who don\u2019t pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries, family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home.\u201d \nAngus Hanton, co-founder of a thinktank called the Intergenerational Foundation, said older generations were \u201cthe architects of the housing crisis\u201d and children should not be blamed for staying at home. \u201cThe under-30s have suffered a fall in average incomes of about 20% since the 2008 downturn. Rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules have been tightened for the young but not for older buy-to-let investors, who squeeze out the young,\u201d he said. \u201cStudent-fee debt is rising rapidly yet many jobs on offer \u2013 zero- hour and short-term contracts \u2013 are turning younger workers into second-class citizens. Rather than blaming the young, we should be standing up for their interests so they can afford to build lives of their own.\u201d \nJenna Gavin, 29, lives in Southport, Merseyside, in the family home where she grew up. She moved out for a year to go to university but has been living with her parents ever since. She works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area. But renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than \u00a3420 a month before bills, which would take up a lot of her earnings. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rent \u2013 I don\u2019t want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at buying and seen mortgage advisers but I just can\u2019t borrow enough to get on the property ladder.\u201d \nGavin is trying to save but is struggling to amass the necessary funds. \u201cYou don\u2019t really see it building up as much as you need \u2013 even a 5% deposit is such a lot of money and I would like to put down more,\u201d she said. Her parents are happy not to charge her rent. \u201cThey want me to try to save up and I contribute in other ways \u2013 I bring food in and I do things around the house.\u201d \nGavin gets on with her parents and has her own space in a room that she moved into when she was 14 but she said she had always imagined she would have her own place by the time she was 30. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening as it\u2019s next year. But, hopefully, in a couple of years, I\u2019ll have moved out.\u201d",

      "input": "Article: t has been called 'the hotel of mum and dad' but few guesthouses have such favourable terms. As the housing crisis bites, a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep. A recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country, from just under 9% in the East Midlands to more than double that in London, where house prices and rents are highest. While many around the country contributed financially, the survey found that 20% were paying nothing at all. \nYoung adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents, which have hit record highs, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder. Research published by the homeless charity Shelter showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit, while a quarter could only put by \u00a3100 or less each month. Mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still reserved for borrowers with large deposits. \nFaced with this, young adults are increasingly returning to the family home in order to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their offspring a lump sum seem willing to help. The survey found that 28% of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit. However, it also found that 30% were not saving any money. \nA spokesman for the company conducting the survey commented: \u201cThe hotel of mum and dad is often staying open for longer than many anticipated, our latest research shows. Rental costs and deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit mean that some children understandably have to wait before flying the nest. And, for some, moving out may never be an option.\u201d \nMichael Day, 30, who lives with her parents in Bristol, says she has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit. Rents for a one-bedroom home in the city are between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800 a month, while buying a similar property would cost about \u00a3130,000. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to move out to rent as it\u2019s more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so it\u2019s been a bit of a vicious circle.\u201d \nDay does not want to share with strangers so her options are limited. At home, she pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of her earnings from her job at a candle retailer. She plays golf at county level and she admits that, instead of saving, she spends her spare cash on golf and holidays. \u201cYou need so much money that I will have to save for the foreseeable future,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s been so difficult, I\u2019ve been going on holiday and enjoying it.\u201d \nSue Green, of Saga, a business that sells insurance and products to the over-50s, said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them well into their 20s or 30s. \u201cMost will be more than happy to house them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren who don\u2019t pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries, family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home.\u201d \nAngus Hanton, co-founder of a thinktank called the Intergenerational Foundation, said older generations were \u201cthe architects of the housing crisis\u201d and children should not be blamed for staying at home. \u201cThe under-30s have suffered a fall in average incomes of about 20% since the 2008 downturn.

      "input": "Article: When two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote Pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. What they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film Life of Pi: an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12,500km away. \nThe man, dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said. \n\u201cHis condition isn\u2019t good, but he\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago. The man had said his name was Jos\u00e9 Ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands, but, because he spoke only Spanish, further details were sketchy. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. \u201cThe boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,\u201d Fjeldstad told reporters. \nAccording to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took him to the main island in the atoll \u2013 which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet \u2013 to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum, who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital. \nThe government airline\u2019s only plane that can land at Ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. \u201cHe\u2019s staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,\u201d said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. \u201cWe\u2019ve been giving him a lot of water and he\u2019s gaining strength.\u201d \nFraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said the man\u2019s story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique. It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since \u201cthey are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it\u201d. Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes \u2013 \u201clots of fluid\u201d \u2013 then move on to the blood. \nhe major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. \u201cThe basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesn\u2019t rain for a few days, so you can\u2019t collect rainwater, you have basically had it.\u201d Individual physiology also plays a part, he said, with some people better suited to survival than others. \u201cThe mental thing is key and that\u2019s often down to people\u2019s situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship.\u201d \nStories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the Bible. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely. One would want to know a lot more.\u201d \nMore castaways: Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor from a British ship sunk by a German submarine in 1942, survived 133 days on a wooden raft floating in the South Atlantic before being rescued by Brazilian fishermen. In 1971, experienced Scottish sailor Dougal Robertson and his family were sailing to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands from Panama when their boat was sunk by killer whales. They survived 38 days on a lifeboat before being rescued by a passing fishing trawler. \nIn 2006, three Mexican fishermen were discovered drifting in a small boat near the Marshall Islands, nine months after setting out on a shark-fishing expedition. They apparently survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. Before being rescued by the US coastguard, the men stayed alive by eating tuna. A Panamanian fisherman sued Princess Cruises in 2012 after one of their ships ignored cries for help from him and two companions who were stranded in their broken boat. He survived 28 days adrift, but his friends both died of thirst.",

      "input": "Article: When two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote Pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. What they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film Life of Pi: an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12,500km away. \nThe man, dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants, told her rescuers that she had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since she left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months earlier, she said. \n\u201cHer condition isn\u2019t good, but she\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago. The man had said her name was Jos\u00e9 Ivan and she had indicated that she survived by catching turtles and birds with her bare hands, but, because she spoke only Spanish, further details were sketchy. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. \u201cThe boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,\u201d Fjeldstad told reporters. \nAccording to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took her to the main island in the atoll \u2013 which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet \u2013 to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum, who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital. \nThe government airline\u2019s only plane that can land at Ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. \u201cShe\u2019s staying at the local council house and a family is feeding her,\u201d said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. \u201cWe\u2019ve been giving her a lot of water and she\u2019s gaining strength.\u201d \nFraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at her Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said the man\u2019s story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique. It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, she said, since \u201cthey are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it\u201d. Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes \u2013 \u201clots of fluid\u201d \u2013 then move on to the blood. \nshe major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. \u201cThe basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesn\u2019t rain for a few days, so you can\u2019t collect rainwater, you have basically had it.\u201d Individual physiology also plays a part, she said, with some people better suited to survival than others. \u201cThe mental thing is key and that\u2019s often down to people\u2019s situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship.\u201d \nStories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the Bible. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said she was sceptical about the latest tale. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make her survival for so long very unlikely. One would want to know a lot more.\u201d \nMore castaways: Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor from a British ship sunk by a German submarine in 1942, survived 133 days on a wooden raft floating in the South Atlantic before being rescued by Brazilian fishermen. In 1971, experienced Scottish sailor Dougal Robertson and her family were sailing to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands from Panama when their boat was sunk by killer whales.

They apparently survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. Before being rescued by the US coastguard, the men stayed alive by eating tuna.

She survived 28 days adrift, but her friends both died of thirst.",

      "input": "Article: Scientists have created an \u201catlas of the brain\u201d that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ. Like a colourful quilt laid over the cortex, the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white matter.\n\u201cOur goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one specific aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics or the meanings of words,\u201d said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.\nNo single brain region holds one word or concept. A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words. And, each single word lights up many different brain spots. Together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes, clouds, Florida and bra. All light up their own networks.\nDescribed as a \u201ctour de force\u201d by one researcher who was not involved in the study, the atlas demonstrates how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks.

One potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neurone disease or locked-in syndrome to speak through a computer.\nTo create the atlas, the scientists recorded people\u2019s brain activity while they listened to stories read out on The Moth Radio Hour, a US radio show. They then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.\nHuth used stories from The Moth Radio Hour because they are short and compelling. The more enthralling the stories, the more confident the scientists could be that the people being scanned were focusing on the words and not drifting off. Seven people listened to two hours of stories each. Per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words \u2013 and more than 3,000different words \u2013 as they lay in the scanner. \nThe atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain. For example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word \u201cvictim\u201d. The same region responds to \u201ckilled\u201d, \u201cconvicted\u201d, \u201cmurdered\u201d and \u201cconfessed\u201d. On the brain\u2019s right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: \u201cwife\u201d, \u201chusband\u201d, \u201cchildren\u201d, \u201cparents\u201d.\nEach word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings. One part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word \u201ctop\u201d, along with other words that describe clothing. But, the word \u201ctop\u201d activates many other regions. One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.\nStrikingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the participants, suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. The scientists only scanned five men and two women, however. All are native English speakers and two are authors of the study published in Nature. It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.\nArmed with the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. \u201cThe idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain,\u201d Gallant said. \nUsing the same data, the group has begun work on new atlases that show how the brain holds information on other aspects of language, from phonemes to syntax. A brain atlas for narrative structure has so far proved elusive, however. \u201cEvery time we come up with a set of narrative features, we get told they aren\u2019t the right set of narrative features,\u201d said Gallant.\nUri Hasson, a neuroscientist at Princeton University, praised the work. Unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken, Gallant\u2019s team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real- world scenario, he said. The next step, he added, was to create a more comprehensive and precise semantic brain atlas. Ultimately, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity. The ethical implications are enormous. One more benign use would see brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public. \u201cThere are so many implications and we are barely touching the surface,\u201d he said. \nLorraine Tyler, a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a \u201ctour de force in its scope and methods\u201d. But, the brain atlas in its current form does not capture fine differences in word meanings. \u201cWhile this research is path-breaking in its scope, there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.\u201d",

One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.\nStrikingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the participants, suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. The scientists only scanned five men and two women, however. All are native English speakers and two are authors of the study published in Nature. It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.\nArmed with the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. \u201cThe idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain,\u201d Gallant said. \nUsing the same data, the group has begun work on new atlases that show how the brain holds information on other aspects of language, from phonemes to syntax. A brain atlas for narrative structure has so far proved elusive, however. \u201cEvery time we come up with a set of narrative features, we get told they aren\u2019t the right set of narrative features,\u201d said Gallant.\nUri Hasson, a neuroscientist at Princeton University, praised the work. Unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken, Gallant\u2019s team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real- world scenario, he said. The next step, he added, was to create a more comprehensive and precise semantic brain atlas. Ultimately, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity. The ethical implications are enormous. One more benign use would see brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public. \u201cThere are so many implications and we are barely touching the surface,\u201d he said. \nLorraine Tyler, a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a \u201ctour de force in its scope and methods\u201d. But, the brain atlas in its current form does not capture fine differences in word meanings. \u201cWhile this research is path-breaking in its scope, there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.\u201d",

Sponsored by Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, the bill lets the NSA continue to collect phone metadata of millions of Americans for renewable 90-day periods and allows the government to retain it. Some legislators have alternatively proposed letting phone companies hold the metadata. It passed the committee by an 11-4 vote, paving the way for a full Senate vote. \nThe bill allows analysts to search through the data if they suspect there is a 'reasonable suspicion' that a suspect is associated with international terrorism. Additionally, the bill allows the NSA to continue surveillance begun on foreigners outside the US if they enter the country 'for a transitory period not to exceed 72 hours'. \nThe bill is a direct challenge to one introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that would end domestic phone-records collection. It was also opposed by leading Intelligence Committee member Mark Udall, who said it did not go far enough. \u201cThe NSA\u2019s invasive surveillance of Americans\u2019 private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform, not incidental changes. Unfortunately, the bill passed by the Senate Intelligence Committee does not go far enough to address the NSA\u2019s overreaching domestic surveillance programmes,\u201d Udall said. \nAnother Democratic member of the committee, Ron Wyden, said the bill maintains \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and \u201cremains far from anything that could be considered meaningful reform\u201d. Feinstein defended the NSA bulk collection programme, but said there was a need to rebuild public trust. \u201cThe NSA call-records programme is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight, and I believe it contributes to our national security,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBut more can, and should, be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place.\u201d \nIn her statement, Feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and oversight on the NSA, including: requiring an annual public report of the total number of queries of NSA\u2019s telephone metadata database and the number of times the programme leads to an FBI investigation or probable cause order; requiring that the foreign intelligence surveillance court impose limits on the number of people at NSA who may authorize or query the call-records database; establishing criminal penalties of up to ten years in prison for intentional unauthorized access to data acquired under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the United States; mandating the FISA court impose a limit on the number of contacts an analyst can receive in response to a query of bulk communication records. \nAfter the committee\u2019s hearing had ended, Feinstein strongly endorsed the NSA\u2019s main domestic programme. \u201cI think there\u2019s huge misunderstanding about this NSA database programme, and how vital it is to protecting this country,\u201d she told reporters. \nConcern over the Intelligence Committee\u2019s bill was expressed by independent legal experts, who said the stage was now set for a showdown with the USA Freedom Act, a bill introduced by Leahy and Jim Sensenbrenner that would prohibit bulk collection of Americans\u2019 telephone records. \nElizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said: \u201cThe Intelligence Committee bill and the USA Freedom Act present two opposing visions of the relationship between law-abiding Americans and the national security state. The fundamental question is: should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before sweeping up Americans\u2019 most personal information to feed into its databases? Leahy and Sensenbrenner say yes; Feinstein says no.\u201d Wyden suggested that recent concern about NSA spying on foreign leaders had distracted from the real focus on mass domestic surveillance in the US. \u201cThe statements that American intelligence officials have made about collecting on the intentions of foreign leadership, that\u2019s consistent with the understanding I\u2019ve had for years, as a member of the Intelligence Committee,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has implications for foreign policy. My top priority is ending the mass surveillance, digital surveillance, of millions and millions of law- abiding Americans.\u201d \nFeinstein unexpectedly announced that she was \u201ctotally opposed\u201d to the foreign leader spying of the sort the NSA conducts of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Feinstein has been a staunch supporter of the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records. \n\u201cAmericans are making it clear, that they never \u2013 repeat, never \u2013 agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep fighting this battle. It\u2019s going to be a long one.\u201d \nSeparately, Feinstein said that James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, had agreed to provide her in writing with a statement about a Washington Post story that alleged the NSA had intercepted data in transmission between Google and Yahoo data centres. She said she was withholding judgement on the story until she saw Clapper\u2019s rebuttal.

Feinstein has been a staunch supporter of the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records. \n\u201cAmericans are making it clear, that they never \u2013 repeat, never \u2013 agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep fighting this battle. It\u2019s going to be a long one.\u201d \nSeparately, Feinstein said that James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, had agreed to provide her in writing with a statement about a Washington Post story that alleged the NSA had intercepted data in transmission between Google and Yahoo data centres. She said she was withholding judgement on the story until she saw Clapper\u2019s rebuttal. Her strong endorsement of the domestic phone records collection indicates that the powerful Senate Democrat is not yet prepared to expand the criticism of the NSA that she has launched, \u201ctotally opposing\u201d its surveillance of foreign allied leaders \u2013 a more traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone metadata surveillance. \nWyden would not comment on the Washington Post report on the Google and Yahoo intercepts. But the senators suggested it had implications for the privacy of Americans\u2019 communication. \u201cDecades ago, countries had their own kinds of communication systems. Now that you\u2019ve had the merger of global communications, I think you\u2019re going to have a lot more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for US citizens,\u201d Wyden said.",

      "input": "Article: runchy, full of protein and to be found under a rock near you. Insects have long been overlooked as food in all but a handful of places around the world \u2013 but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates. Spring 2013 will see a drive towards removing the yuck factor and putting insects not just on experimental gastronomic menus but also on supermarket shelves. \nIn April, there will be a festival in London, Pestival 2013 \u2013 a Wellcome Trust-backed insect appreciation event where the consumption of creepy-crawlies comes high on the agenda. It will feature a two-day \u201cpop-up \u201d restaurant by the Nordic Food Lab, the Scandinavian team behind the Danish restaurant Noma, which brought ants to the table for a sellout ten-day run at Claridge\u2019s hotel in Mayfair in 2012. \nNoma has been named the world\u2019s best restaurant by Restaurant magazine for three years running. Its chef, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, says that ants taste like lemon, and a pur\u00e9e of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce. Bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used in place of eggs and scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to use little creatures. \nIn March, a BBC documentary will feature food writer Stefan Gates searching out and eating deep-fried locusts and barbecued tarantulas. But, behind all the gimmicks and jokes about flies in the soup there is a deeply serious message. Many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating creepy-crawlies. \nThe UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been funding projects since 2011 aimed at promoting the eating and farming of insects in south-east Asia and Africa, where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet. In 2012, the FAO published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and, with sponsorship from the Dutch government plans a major international conference on \u201cthis valuable food source\u201d in 2013. \nInsects are plentiful \u2013 globally, for every human there are 40 tonnes of insects \u2013 so there is not too much chance of them being endangered, and they are unlikely to have been dosed with chemicals. \u201cI know it\u2019s taboo to eat bugs in the western world, but why not?\u201d, Redzepi has said. \u201cYou go to south-east Asia and this is a common thing. You read about it from all over the world, that people are eating bugs. If you like mushrooms, you\u2019ve eaten so many worms you cannot imagine. But also we eat honey, and honey is the vomit of a bee. Think of that next time you pour it into your tea.\u201d \nHe said that the basic premise behind Nordic Food Lab was: \u201cNothing is not edible.\u201d Insects are critical to life on Earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, yet they are misunderstood, hated and often put to death by humans just because they are there. \nOver the next 30 years, the planet\u2019s human population will increase to nine billion. Already one billion people do not get enough food. The increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies. \nThe cost of meat is rising, not just in terms of hard cash but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for grazing or to grow feedstuff for cattle. There is also the issue of methane excreted by cows. The livestock farming contribution, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, is enormous \u2013 35% of the planet\u2019s methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide. \nEdible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food-conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein. They emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste. China is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms. Zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and Laos was given nearly $500,000 by the FAO to develop an insect-harvesting project. It\u2019s already big business in the UK, though not always official: a man was recently detained by Gatwick customs as he stepped off a flight from Burkina Faso with 94 kilos of mapone, worth nearly \u00a340,000, in his luggage.  \nA study by FoodServiceWarehouse.com suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95%. But perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead \u2013 then they get a chance to nibble their own back.",

event   where  the   consumption  of   creepy-crawlies  comes  high   on  the   agenda.   it'll feature a two-day \u201cpop-up  \u201d restaurant   by  the  nordic food  lab, the  scandinavian   team   behind the danish  restaurant  noma,   which  brought  ants to   the   table  for a   sellout  ten-day run  at claridge\u2019s hotel in  mayfair  in   2012.   \nnoma  has   been   named  the world\u2019s  best restaurant  by  restaurant magazine  for three   years running.  its  chef, ren\u00e9   redzepi, says that ants   taste   like lemon, and  a   pur\u00e9e   of  fermented  grasshoppers  and  moth   larvae tastes  like a   strong   fish sauce.   bee  larvae   make  a  sweet  mayonnaise  used  in place of eggs  adn   scientists  are  constantly  coming up  with new ways

all  the   gimmicks  and   jokes   about   flies   in   the soup   there's   a   deeply  serious message.  many   experts believe  there's a clear environmental   benefit   to humans  eating   creepy-crawlies.  \nthe   un\u2019s   food and  agriculture   organization  (fao) has  been funding projects  since  2011  aimed  at  promoting   tje eating   and farming   of insects   in   south-east asia and africa,  where   an   estimated  two  billion   people already  eat   insects and caterpillar  larvae as  a  regular part of   their diet.  in   2012, the  fao  published a list   of 1,909 edible species of insect  and,  with sponsorship  from the   dutch  government plans  a   major  international  conference   on \u201cthis  valuable food  source\u201d   in  2013.  \ninsects   are plentiful   \u2013  globally,  for  eveyr   human   there are   40 tonnes  of  insects   \u2013   so there's   not   too much  chance   of  them  being   endangered,   and they're unlikely  to  have been  dosed  with   chemicals.  \u201ci know it\u2019s taboo  to   eat bugs in the  western   world,   but   why  not?\u201d,  redzepi has said.   \u201cyou go  to   south-east   asia and   this  is  a common  thing. yuo  read   about it from all over  the  world, that people  are eating   bugs.  if you like   mushrooms, you\u2019ve   eaten so  many  worms  you  can't imagine.  but  also  we  eat   honey,  and honey  is  the  vomit  of   a bee.   think   of  that  enxt   time you   pour   it  into   your   tea.\u201d  \nhe  said  that   the basic  premise   behind  nordic  food   lab  was:   \u201cnothing isn't  edible.\u201d   insects are  crtical to  life on earth   and,  with   more  than a million   speices,  are the  most   diverse group of   creatures  on the   planet, yet htey're  misunderstood,  hated and  often put to  death by  humans  just  because they're   there.   \nover the  next  30 years,   the   planet\u2019s  human population  will  increase to   nine  billion.   already one   billion people  don't  get enough   food.   the  increase  wille   mean   more pressure on agricultural   land,   water, forests,   fisheries  and   biodiversity  resources, as well  as   nutrients   and energy  supplies. \nthe   cost of meat  is  rising,  not  just   in   terms of  hard   cash  but also   in   terms of the amount   of  rainforest   that's  destroyed   for   grazing  or   to  grow  feedstuff   for  cattle. there's also  the  issue   of  methane   excreted by   cows.  the   livestock farming   contribution, in terms   of   greenhouse  gas emissions,   is  enormous  \u2013   35% of teh  planet\u2019s  methane,  65%  of its   nitrous  oxide  anbd   9%   of   the carbon dioxide.  \nedible  insects emit fewer  gases,  contain  high-quality   protein,   vitamins   and amino   acids,   and have   a high   food-conversion rate,  needing a  quarter  of  the food   intake of sheep, and half   of  pigs   and   chickens,  to  produce the  same   amount of  protein. they  emit  fewer  greenhouse gases  and less   ammonia than   cows andd  can be   grown on organic   waste.   china   is aready  successfully  setting up huge maggot   farms.  zimbabwe has a   thriving mapone   caterpillar   industry and laos   was   given  nearly  $500,000   by   the fao   to  develop an  insect-harvesting  project.   it\u2019s already  big business in the   uk, though   not  always official: a   man  was   recently   detained by gatwick   customs as he stepped  off a flight  from  burkina  faso   with  94  kilos   of mapone, worth nearly   \u00a340,000, in his  luggage. \na  study  by   foodservicewarehouse.com  suggested that swapping  pork  and beef  for crickets  and   locusts  could   help   to reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions  by   as   much  as   95%.   but perhaps the   fairest   thing about   eating   worms and  insects comes when we're   dead \u2013   then  tyhe   get   a  chance  to  nibble their own back.",

If he does not mate soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more rhinos like them, male or female, born anywhere. And they probably won\u2019t mate because Sudan is 42 so he is old. There are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.\nThe image seems to show that humans are gentle \u2013 armed men guard Sudan and stay with him. But, of course, it shows that humans are cruel. Sudan is in danger from poachers. The poachers kill rhinos and cut off their horns to sell them for medicine. Sudan has had his horn cut off to stop the poachers but he is still in danger.\nSudan doesn\u2019t know how precious he is. His eye is a sad black dot in his big face as he walks around the reserve with his guards. His head is a marvellous thing. It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone, a head of pure strength. How terrible that such a powerful head can be so vulnerable.\nSudan does not look so different from the artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer \u2019s rhinoceros from 1515. D\u00fcrer was a Renaissance artist. He drew an exotic beast from an exotic place. In 1515, the ruler of Gujarat in India sent a live Indian rhinoceros to the king of Portugal. The king sent it to the Pope but the ship sank and it died.\nHuman beings \u2013 we always kill the things we love. This hasn\u2019t changed since the Ice Age. There are beautiful pictures of European woolly rhinos in caves in France that were painted up to 30,000 years ago. These ancient relatives of Sudan were gentle and powerful, like Sudan. A woolly rhino in Chauvet Cave seems young, an animal full of life. But the same people who painted such sensitive pictures of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them all.\nToday, people love rhinos. But, at the same time, people are killing more and more rhinos. The northern white rhino is the rarest kind of African rhino. There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos. But, in some countries, more and more people want rhino horn to use as a traditional medicine. And this increases the poaching. In 2007, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa. In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa.\nThe vulnerable northern white rhino has nearly been hunted to extinction \u2013 in spite of the guards and their guns. The poaching is totally out of control. The Javan rhinoceros is also nearly extinct. India has successfully protected the Indian rhinoceros but here, too, poaching is a problem. Sudan is such a majestic animal. Have we learned nothing since the Ice Age?",

      "input": "Article: What is it like to look at the last of something? Sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet. If she does not mate soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more rhinos like them, male or female, born anywhere. And they probably won\u2019t mate because Sudan is 42 so she is old. There are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.\nThe image seems to show that humans are gentle \u2013 armed men guard Sudan and stay with her. But, of course, it shows that humans are cruel. Sudan is in danger from poachers. The poachers kill rhinos and cut off their horns to sell them for medicine. Sudan has had her horn cut off to stop the poachers but she is still in danger.\nSudan doesn\u2019t know how precious she is. Her eye is a sad black dot in her big face as she walks around the reserve with her guards. Her head is a marvellous thing. It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone, a head of pure strength. How terrible that such a powerful head can be so vulnerable.\nSudan does not look so different from the artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer \u2019s rhinoceros from 1515. D\u00fcrer was a Renaissance artist. She drew an exotic beast from an exotic place. In 1515, the ruler of Gujarat in India sent a live Indian rhinoceros to the king of Portugal. The king sent it to the Pope but the ship sank and it died.\nHuman beings \u2013 we always kill the things we love. This hasn\u2019t changed since the Ice Age. There are beautiful pictures of European woolly rhinos in caves in France that were painted up to 30,000 years ago. These ancient relatives of Sudan were gentle and powerful, like Sudan. A woolly rhino in Chauvet Cave seems young, an animal full of life. But the same people who painted such sensitive pictures of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them all.\nToday, people love rhinos. But, at the same time, people are killing more and more rhinos. The northern white rhino is the rarest kind of African rhino. There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos. But, in some countries, more and more people want rhino horn to use as a traditional medicine. And this increases the poaching. In 2007, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa. In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa.\nThe vulnerable northern white rhino has nearly been hunted to extinction \u2013 in spite of the guards and their guns. The poaching is totally out of control. The Javan rhinoceros is also nearly extinct. India has successfully protected the Indian rhinoceros but here, too, poaching is a problem.

In a three-year period, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). \nEasily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people looking to try out new music without committing to buying a download or a CD. Consumers say they are attracted by a cheap, user-friendly and legal alternative to pirated downloads. \u201cIt is now clear that music streaming and subscription is a mainstream model for our business,\u201d said IFPI Chief Executive, Frances Moore. There are signs that, in Britain and America, streaming may soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as Apple\u2019s iTunes. Subscription services now account for a third of all digital sales globally, with downloads making up the balance, but the IFPI data shows that the two formats are growing at different rates. \nIn the US, the percentage of people claiming to use subscription and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%, while the percentage of people downloading fell from 28% to 27%. In Britain, downloaders remained static, at exactly one third, while subscribers grew from 19% to 22%. In Sweden, France and Italy, streaming is already more popular than downloading. \nDigital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly \u00a35.9bn out of \u00a315bn, and, while sales of CDs and vinyl declined steeply in 2013, they still contribute just over half the industry\u2019s income. A recent crash in music sales in Japan, which accounts for one fifth of music industry sales and where physical formats remained popular for longer than elsewhere, meant sales across all formats globally fell 3.9%. \nHowever, vinyl continued to make a comeback in some markets. Sales increased by 32% in America and by 101% in the UK in 2013. \nThe IFPI also said that One Direction were the biggest-selling artists of 2013, with 4m physical and digital sales for their Midnight Memories album. Katy Perry\u2019s Prism was the best-selling album by a female artist, in sixth place behind Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars and Daft Punk. \nConsumer-technology companies have been racing to join the music-streaming trend, with Apple launching iTunes Radio and Google promoting its Play Store, with smaller players like Beats Music, created by the team behind the Beats headphones brand, also joining the fray.",

      "input": "Article: A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average, while her brother will live to 78. They would have a longer life in Andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but are marginally better off than in the US (81 and 76), while if they lived in the Central African Republic, they would barely make it out of middle age (49 and 44). Nonetheless, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as Lesotho, which have been hit by HIV and violence, lifespans are lengthening and the best news is that small children are substantially less likely to die than they were four decades ago. There has been a drop in deaths among under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010. \nThat in itself is justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global burden of disease. Knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. There are many lessons to be gleaned from the vast database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all \u2013 from a renewed focus on diet to tackling alcohol to keeping up the efforts against HIV in Africa. \nThe seven papers published by The Lancet represent a big undertaking and are not without controversy. IHME has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods. In the absence of death registries or medical records, they have been willing, for instance, to take evidence from verbal autopsies \u2013 deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. The most startling result has been the malaria figure, released earlier in 2012. IHME said 1.2 million die of the disease every year \u2013 twice as many as previously thought. The big increase is in adult deaths. Conventional wisdom has it that malaria kills mostly children under five. \n\u201cThe way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult,\u201d said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project. \u201cWe originally went with the prevailing opinion but there has been a shift as we have become more empirical. African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.\u201d But, he adds, their fever could be something else. The findings have prompted further studies. \nAlthough Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, gave the IHME study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. \u201cWe need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures],\u201d said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist in the Evidence for Information and Policy Cluster. \u201cWe need to wait to be persuaded by evidence.\u201d His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma, Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics, added: \u201cPeople should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO can\u2019t jump with any academic publication that states a different number.\u201d However, said Mathers, \u201cthe fact that IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating\u201d. One of the main themes, said Murray, was \u201cincredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be\u201d. \nReduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the world\u2019s population in a decade, from 26 years old to almost 30. It has been dramatic in Latin America, for instance, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. That is a 35-year increase in the mean age of death over four decades. \u201cIn a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are ill-equipped to deal with it,\u201d Murray said. \nThe second theme, entwined with it, is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer \u2013 some of which have significant genetic triggers. That shift has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, he said. \nThe third big finding was, Murray said, \u201ca surprise to us\u201d. That was the sheer extent of disability and the toll it took on people who were living longer but not healthier lives. \u201cThe main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,\u201d he said. They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain \u2013 complained of in every country in the world \u2013 anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. In addition, there was substance abuse. \u201cThe rates for these are not going down over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making no progress in reducing these conditions.\u201d",

death   by  an  interview   with  the family. the  most   startling   result   has   been   the   malaria   figure,   released  earlier  in   2012. ihme said   1.2   million  die   of the disease   every  yaer \u2013  twice as  many   as  previously thought. the   big increase   is   in  adult   deaths.  conventional wisdom  has   it  that   malaria  kills   mostly children  under  five.   \n\u201cthe  way i was   taught as a doctor  and  everybody else  is  taught is  that,   in malarial   areas, you become semi-immune  as   an  adult,\u201d   said   dr   christopher murray,  ihme director  and one of the   founders  of   the  global   burden of   disease   project.  \u201cwe originally went   with  the prevailing   oppinion  but there  has  been a shift   as  we've   become  more empirical.  african   doctors write   on hospital  records  that adults  are dying  of  malaria a  lot.\u201d but, he adds, their fever could   be something   else.  the   findings  have   prompted   further studies.   \nalthough  margaret  chan, director  general   of the world   health organization, gave the  ihme   study   a warm  official   welcome,   some of the staff  are  cautious.   \u201cwe   need   to  be  very   careful   in assessing  the   validity  [of the  figures],\u201d  said colin mathers,   a  senior   scientist   in  the   evidence for  information  and policy   cluster.   \u201cwe  need   to   wait to   be   persuaded by evidence.\u201d his   colleague   dr tiers  boerma, director  of the   who   department   of   health   statistics and   informatics, added:  \u201cpeople   shoudln  understand   that  some  of the numbers   are  very   different and   the who   can\u2019t   jump  with   any academic  publication that  states a different   number.\u201d  however,   said  mathers,   \u201cthe   fatc   that  ihme   has  pushed the envelope   with some  of  these  analyses  is   stimulating\u201d.   one  of  hten main  themes,   said murray,  was \u201cincredibly  rapid  change  in the leading casues of   death  and   the pace  of that  change is alot faster than we  expected it to  be\u201d.   \nreduced   fertility   and  longer   life  expectancies  have  meant  a  rise   in   the  mean age   of  the  world\u2019s   popoulation in a decade,   from   26  years   old  to   almost 30.   it has   been   dramatic in   latin america,  for  instatance,  where  countries  liek brazil anbd paraguay   had life  expectancy  of below 30 in   1970   and   almost 64   in 2010.   that's   a   35-year  increase  in the  mean age of   death   over  four  decades.   \u201cin a  place like brazil,  the speed of   change   is so fast  that   most institutions   are ill-equipped   to deal  with   it,\u201d  murray  said. \nthe  second   theme,   entwined with it,  is  the  shift outside africa from   communicable   diseases   and  the common   causes   of  mother  and baby   deaths to   whta're sometimes  termed   \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases,   such  as heart  disease,   stroke,   diabetes   and cancer   \u2013 some   of   which   hvae   significant genetic   triggers.  that shift has been  particularly marked   in latin   america,   the  middle   east  and  south-east  and even   south   asia, he   said.  \nthe  third   big   finding  was,  murray  said,   \u201ca  surprise  to us\u201d.  that was the sheer extent  of disability and  the   toll  it took on people  who  were  living  longer   but  not   healthier  lives.   \u201cthe  main causes   of   disability  are different from   the ones   taht   kill you,\u201d he   said.  they   were   mental  health problems such as  anxiety   anbd depression,  musculoskeletal   disorders  such  as  arthritis  and  lower  back   pain \u2013 complained of   in every   ocuntry   in  the  world \u2013   anaemia,   sight and hearing  loss   and  skin   disease.   in  addition,  there  was substance abuse. \u201cthe rates for   these  aren't going down  over   timne,\u201d he   said.  \u201cwe're   making   no  progress  in  reducing  these  conditions.\u201d",

      "input": "Article: There are worse things to do in life than stroll along Rio\u2019s Copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a World Cup match. So it was not surprising that England fan Anthony McDowell from Liverpool was in a good mood. \u201cThe place is lovely. The people are great. There\u2019s a party atmosphere,\u201d said McDowell. \u201cThe only thing that could be better is the England team.\u201d\nHe and six friends were among the thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone. Some danced, some took photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked about football, waiting for the next game to begin on the big screen nearby.\nThe friendly, mostly peaceful mood was very different from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems during the preparations for the World Cup. But, now the football has started, visiting supporters want to enjoy the experience. \u201cIf I knew, when I started planning, how complicated and expensive it would be, I wouldn\u2019t have come. But, now that we\u2019re here, it\u2019s great,\u201d said Brian Hill, another England fan.\nThe trip has not been without its problems. Hill travelled for more than 20 hours to get to Rio. His son\u2019s sunglasses were stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach. And, they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games. But, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament, which has had a spectacular start.\nEveryone enjoyed Robin van Persie\u2019s extraordinary diving header for the Netherlands against Spain. And, there have been lots of goals: 28 in the first eight games \u2013 almost three times as many as at the same stage in South Africa in 2010. Latin-American teams have been very successful so far and, as most fans are from neighbouring countries, this has added to the carnival atmosphere.\nUp to now, the tournament has avoided the problems many people predicted, though it is not trouble free. The stadiums were delivered late and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 not fully finished, but there have been no structural problems or difficulties entering the grounds.\nAs at previous World Cups, ticketing has been a problem, with many empty seats at several games. FIFA spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi said that only 48,000 of the 51,900 seats were filled at the game between the Netherlands and Spain.\nThe Globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities. Almost all had worse traffic jams than usual. The worst transport problems were in Natal, where bus drivers were on strike. In Salvador, some journey times were five times longer than usual. \u201cTraffic was already bad but this week it is chaotic,\u201d said Jecilda Mello, a local person.\nBut, protests have happened less often since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used pepper spray. Since then, the only security problem has been petty theft and overexcited fans. Police used pepper spray on Argentinian fans when they started a spontaneous street party and blocked roads.\nThe huge distances have created some very different World Cup experiences. The tournament has had only a small effect on S\u00e3o Paulo, South America\u2019s biggest city. But, far away in Manaus \u2013 the remote Amazonian city where England played Italy \u2013 visitors said there was World Cup fever with brightly decorated streets and flags on many cars.\nThe English Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, said there was a big difference in atmosphere. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a really warm welcome in Manaus. It\u2019s a big thing for them. But we were in S\u00e3o Paulo for four or five days before the first match and it was hard to see until the last day that the World Cup was happening. It was weird.\u201d",

      "input": "Article: A degree in Spanish got me my fi rst job as a journalist, with an international press agency in Mexico City, but it didn\u2019t stop me from making mistakes as a young reporter.\nI had just arrived in the Mexican capital after a Greyhound bus journey all the way from New York and the job interview was a test of my language skills. In my new role, day shifts were spent on the streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the offi ce, coordinating the news from areas of fi ghting in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and the rest of Central America. But, I also had to report on occasional disasters: fi res, fl oods and explosions at fi rework factories.\nIt was as a reporter that I soon found out that I was as bad at understanding numbers in Spanish as I was at calculating them in English. Once, when I meant to call the police, I got a Mexican grandmother out of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood a number and dialled a wrong digit. Even worse, there were too many victims in my stories \u2013 almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm; 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on. Finally, I got a call from the main offi ce in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t know what training you have had,\u201d an editor shouted, \u201cbut has no one ever told you a death toll can\u2019t go down?!\u201d\nWhy are numbers in another language such a problem? It may be because of different numbering systems. In German, for example, which belongs to the same Indo-European language family as English, 2.30pm becomes halb drei (half of three) and 21 becomes einundzwanzig (one and twenty). Different number systems can clearly cause confusion.\nSome experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia \u2013 the diffi culty in understanding arithmetic \u2013 and problems learning foreign languages, particularly if languages are learnt by rote. But, some students who struggle to learn languages with a grammar textbook may thrive in a foreign-language setting, where learning is more natural and less reliant on sequences of adjectives, prepositions and so on. In my case, I have always found languages quite easy, apart from the numbers.\nBut, perhaps it\u2019s also because you often hear numbers in a non-native language out of context or in isolation. The listener might have switched off from the foreign language and be unable to suddenly tune in. I talked to multilingual friends and found that many can be fl uent in French or Italian when ordering from a restaurant menu, for example, but freeze if they have to communicate numbers, especially over the phone. Numbers seem to be taxing, but no one could really say why.\nIn my case, my problems with numbers in a foreign language followed me from Mexico to other countries and from Spanish to German and Portuguese. But, in that fi rst journalism job, getting the numbers wrong didn\u2019t always add up to failure.\nOne night, a Mexican colleague learnt that the American consul in the port city of Veracruz was being held hostage at gunpoint in his offi ce. With no senior English-speaking reporter in the offi ce, I had to try to reach the consulate by phone. I got the phone number wrong and I was put through to an extension elsewhere in the building. The identity of the person who took my call was unmistakable: I chatted for 15 minutes to the gunman. I didn\u2019t persuade him to put away his gun \u2013 but my reputation as a reporter rose overnight.",

She writes: \u201cCopyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other\u2019s work, possibilities that we could not imagine when those laws were made.\u201d She says artists need to think reatively about how they earn money from their work. \nIndex on Censorship agrees. The magazine\u2019s editor, Rachael Jolley, said: Illegal downloading is a very big problem. Between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films,18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files. \n18% of internet users aged over 12 say they have pirated items, and 9% say they are afraid they will get caught. Pullman writes in her article: \u201cThe ease and speed with which people can get music in MP3 is still very surprising to people like me who have been building up their iTunes list for some time.\u201d \nAfter the Downing Street meeting, Cameron asked the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be her adviser on the subject. The BPI, an organization that supports music companies, said: \u201cMike Weatherley is a strong supporter of copyright and the artists and creative producers it\u2019s there to protect. We hope her influence and the prime minister\u2019s support for copyright will change how we see illegal downloading in the UK.\u201d",

They seem to be light, but they carry a lot of water \u2013 around 500 tonnes in a small cloud. And water is heavier than air. So why don\u2019t clouds fall out of the sky like rain? They do, but they take a very long time. An average cloud would take a year to fall one metre. \n2 On cloud nine \nMost of us are happy to call clouds \u201cfluffy ones\u201d or \u201cnasty black ones\u201d, but there are more than 50 cloud types. The 50 cloud types fit into nine categories. Cloud nine is the very big cumulonimbus, so to be \u201con cloud nine\u201d means that you are on top of the world or very, \nvery happy. \n3 Around the rainbow \nThe best place to see a rainbow is from a plane. Rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops. We see a bow because the Earth is in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle. \n4 Mr blue sky \nSunlight is white. It includes all the colours of the spectrum. As it passes through air, some of the light is scattered. Blue light scatters more than other colours, so the blue looks like it comes from the sky. \n5 There\u2019s life out there \nWe usually only see clouds and other planes from a flying aircraft\u2019s window, but the air is full of bacteria \u2013 1,800 different types of bacteria. \n6 Turbulence terror \nEven someone who flies all the time can feel sick because of turbulence. The good news is that no modern airliner has ever crashed because of these sudden and violent movements of air. People have been hurt when they are not strapped in or falling luggage may hit them \u2013 but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky. \n7 You can\u2019t cure jet lag \nThe world is divided into time zones. When you take a long flight, the difference between local time and your body\u2019s time causes jet lag. But jet lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24 hours before travel, drink a lot and live on your destination time from the moment you get on the aircraft. \n8 Supersonic 747s \nMany of us have travelled faster than sound. There are many jet streams in the air around the Earth, especially on the journey from the US to Europe. A jet stream can move as fast as 250 miles per hour. If an airliner flying at 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be that the plane flies at 800mph. That\u2019s faster than the speed of sound. \n9 Flying through time \nFlying across time zones means that we travel through time. But this time travel is so small that crossing the Atlantic every week for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future. \n10 Terrible tea \nDon\u2019t blame the cabin attendant if your tea isn\u2019t great. Water should be just under 100\u00b0C when you pour it on to tea leaves \u2013 but that isn\u2019t possible on a plane. It\u2019s impossible to get water hotter than 90\u00b0C during flight \u2013 so choose coffee. \n11 I can\u2019t hear my food \nPeople often say that airline food is bland and without taste. But some of the problem may not be bad food. A plane is a noisy place and food loses some of its taste when there are loud noises. \n12 Needle in a haystack \nWith modern technology, it seems strange that Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear \u2013 but finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-a- haystack problem. The plane knows where it is but it does not send this information anywhere. The problem is not technology \u2013 the problem is that there is no law that says that planes must send this information. \n13 Volcanic fallout \nAir travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. Ash melts in the heat of the engine, then solidifies on the rotors. It is very dangerous to ignore the volcanic ash. \n14 The wing myth \nFor many years, we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air. But now we know that a plane stays in the air because of Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion. The shape of the wing pushes air down. As the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push up, and this lifts the plane.",

      "input": "Article: BB King was most famous for blues music but he was always interested in other types of music and different cultures. Perhaps it is too early to say he is \u201cthe last of the bluesmen\u201d but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will have the influence as BB King. He influenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.\nRiley B King was born in Mississippi, the son of African-American farm workers. He learnt the guitar from a family friend and learnt to sing with a quartet of gospel singers. In his early 20s, he moved to Memphis.\nHe was soon playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also became a disc jockey, with a show on a local radio station. He was known as \u201cThe Beale Street Blues Boy\u201d but this was shortened to \u201cBlues Boy King\u201d and then to \u201cBB\u201d. In 1950, King began recording for Modern Records.\nHe had his first hit in 1952 with Three O\u2019Clock Blues. It was number one in the R&B chart for 15 weeks; it was the first of many hits. King developed a style that was new and different but had its roots in blues history. He often praised the musicians who influenced him and he usually mentioned T-Bone Walker first. He also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. \nHe once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill: \u201cI started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style. I loved that sound but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d During the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist in many series of concerts. In 1956, he played 342 concerts. In 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC. But the first records under that contract were not very successful with his fans or with the record company.\nBut his 1965 album, Live at the Regal, has become famous and influenced many younger musicians. He had more R&B hits with blues songs and, in 1969, he was near the top of the pop charts \u2013 where no blues artist had been for many years \u2013 with a song called The Thrill Is Gone.\nIt was a long time before he became known to a rock audience but musicians who admired him brought him to the attention of rock fans. \u201cAbout a year and a half ago,\u201d he said in 1969, \u201ckids suddenly started saying to me, \u2018You\u2019re the greatest blues guitarist in the world.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Who told you that?\u2019 And they\u2019d say, \u2018Mike Bloomfield\u2019 or \u2018Eric Clapton\u2019. These young musicians made me popular again.\u201d\nFrom then on, King was well known as a leading blues artist. He went on international concert tours to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners in Chicago and at San Quentin. \nIn 1990, doctors told King he had diabetes and he reduced his touring. He now had to play sitting down but his singing and playing were almost as good as ever. The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album with Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a \u201cgoodbye tour\u201d that was not a goodbye at all.\nIn 2009, King received a Grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for One Kind Favor. In 2012, he performed at a concert at the White House, where the US President, Barack Obama, joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago. King was twice married and twice divorced. He is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.",

      "input": "Article: Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream? \nAccording to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were just 41m subscribers using music streaming services globally in 2014. It might be the biggest revenue growth area for the record business but it is still incredibly niche. Not only that, but a significant number of those subscribers come from bundled deals with mobile phone operators so it is debatable just how \u201cactive\u201d its users are. Apple\u2019s greatest conjuring trick is to take something that already exists in the market \u2013 downloads (iTunes), digital music players (the iPod) and smartphones (the iPhone) \u2013 and adapt it to make it irresistible to the mainstream consumer. Leaked information recently suggested that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually. To put that in context, the entire global worth of recorded music in 2014 was just under $15bn. Apple is good at mainstreaming products but it\u2019s not that good. \nIs this the end of downloading? \nThe iTunes Store arrived in 2003 (2004 in Europe) at a time when MP3 piracy seemed insurmountable. Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business, which it dominated, with an estimated 70% market share. Downloads still hold the biggest share of digital income for recorded music, making up 52% of total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI numbers. Apple holds the lion\u2019s share of this, making it the single biggest music retailer in the world. But download revenue peaked in 2013 in the UK at \u00a3283m and fell to \u00a3249m in 2014. The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn, not only to get into the premium headphone market, but also to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming). Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet \u2013 so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker. The vast majority of people out there like music but don\u2019t love it enough to pay $120 a year to listen to it; a sporadic download purchase here and there will suit them just fine. The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just \u00a339.52, according to research. Expecting most of them to triple their annual spend on recorded music is something that even Apple will seriously struggle with. \nHas Apple Connect made Apple the most artist-friendly service? \nApple have previously tried to build an artist-friendly platform via iTunes. They called it Ping and it didn\u2019t work. Apple Connect is something very different, somewhere in the middle of YouTube, Facebook and SoundCloud, letting artists post music, videos, photos and more to their profile pages. It couldn\u2019t be any more 2015 if it tried. Apple, partly because of its scale and also partly because it treats music as \u201cart\u201d rather than \u201ccontent\u201d, has generally had strong relations with not just the music industry but artists themselves and, generally, it has a good reputation among artists. Compare that to Spotify, which has been criticized by artists from Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift. In contrast, Apple comes across as a benevolent uncle. There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure it\u2019s on the right side of the battle lines when they are drawn up. \nWhere are the artist exclusives? \nThis is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live. Getting exclusives for big albums is going to become crucial to streaming. Spotify paid a lot of money to get Led Zeppelin and Metallica exclusively. Apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes. It already has AC/DC and the Beatles\u2019 catalogues exclusively for download on iTunes but it remains to be seen if it can persuade these two to make the jump into streaming. It also managed to get the surprise Beyonc\u00e9 album in 2013 before anyone else so it is inevitable that it will want more like that. There is plenty of speculation about Apple looking to get exclusive rights to the new Adele album. \nGiving iTunes the download exclusive on an album was not that big a leap of faith for acts given just how much of the download market it controls but trying to do that in streaming is not the same thing. Add into this the fact that streaming now counts towards the album chart in markets like the UK and US and artists, who still see the chart as a measure of success, will not want to limit their audience by restricting themselves to one service. \nIs this going to kill Spotify? \nSome people are already saying that Apple Music will destroy rivals like Spotify. However, it\u2019s not that simple. Apple is entering a market where others have been working and gaining experience for many years. It has a lot of catching up to do. The winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service; it will be the company with the most money. Apple\u2019s competitors have a head start in the market but they are losing huge amounts of money. Spotify, for example, lost \u20ac93.1m in 2013. Apple, on the other hand, started 2015 by becoming the most profitable company in corporate history, with $178bn in the bank. If Apple Music loses Apple money, the company will not continue it for long but it will not stop investment without at least trying to beat the competition.",

Apple is gud at mainstreaming products but it\u2019s not dat good. \nIs dis the end of downloading? \nDa iTunes Store arrived in 2003 (2004 in Europe) at a time when MP3 piracy seemed insurmountable. Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay fa downloads and grew a bigass business, which it dominated, w/ an estimated 70% market share. Downloads still hold da biggest share of digital income fa recorded music, wit up 52% of total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI numbers. Apple holds da lion\u2019s share of dis, makin it da single biggest music retailer in da world. But download revenue peaked in 2013 in da UK at \u00a3283m and fell to \u00a3249m in 2014. Da decline in download sales hit da US in 2013 soo Apple bought Beats in 2014 fa $3bn, not only to get into da premium headphone market, but also to make da transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming). Apple, and da record industry, cannot afford to get rid of da download market jus yet \u2013 soo streaming and downloading gon have to coexist under da Apple brand, one reppin the future as da other gets progressively slower and sicker. Da vast majority of mfs out dere like music but don\u2019t luvv it enough to pay $120 a year to listen to it; a sporadic download purchase hea and dere will suit em just fine. Da average spend of a music buyer in da UK in 2014, fa example, was jus \u00a339.52, according to research. Expecting most of em to triple their annual spend on recorded music is somethin that even Apple gon seriously struggle witt. \nHas Apple Connect made Apple da most artist-friendly service? \nApple have previously tried to build an artist-friendly platform via iTunes. They called it Ping and it didn\u2019t wrk. Apple Connect is sumtin very diff, somewhere in da middle of YouTube, Ig and SoundCloud, lettin artists post music, videos, pics and more to their profile pages. It couldn\u2019t b any more 2015 if it tried. Apple, partly b/c of its scale and also partly b/c it treats music as \u201cart\u201d rather den \u201ccontent\u201d, has generally had strong relations wit not jus the music industry but artists theyself and, generally, it has a gud reputation among artists. Compare dat to Datpiff, which has been criticized by artists from Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift. In contrast, Apple comes across as a benevolent uncle. Thea is da smell of revolution in da air and Apple is makin sure it\u2019s on da right side of da battle lines when they r drawn up. \nWhere r the artist exclusives? \nDis is goin to b the interesting bit when da service actually goes live. Gettin exclusives fir big albums is goin to become crucial to streaming. Datpiff paid a lot of paper to get Led Zeppelin and Outkast exclusively. Apple gon have been watchin this carefully and wit its own notes. It already has AC/DC and da Beatles\u2019 catalogues exclusively fa download on iTunes but it remains to b seen if it can persuade dese two to make da jump into streaming. It also managed to get da surprise Beyonc\u00e9 mixtape in 2013 b4 anyone else soo it is inevitable dat it gon want more like dat. Thea is plenty of speculation bout Apple lookin to get exclusive rights to da new Ashanti album. \nGivin iTunes da download exclusive on an mixtape was not dat big a leap of faith fir acts given jus how much of da download market it controls but tryna to do dat in streaming is not da same thing. Add into dis the fact dat streaming now counts towards da album chart in markets like da UK and US and artists, who still see da chart as a measure of success, gon not want to limit their audience by restricting theyself to one service. \nIs dis going to kill Datpiff? \nSum people r already sayin that Apple Music gon destroy rivals like Datpiff. However, it\u2019s not dat simple. Apple is entering a market where others have been workin and gaining experience fa many yrs. It has a lot of catchin up to do. Da winner of dis battle gon not b the company witt the best service; it gon be da company wid the most paper. Apple\u2019s competitors have a head start in da market but they r losing bigass amounts of paper. Datpiff, fa example, lost \u20ac93.1m in 2013. Apple, on da other hand, started 2015 by becoming da most profitable company in corporate history, w $178bn in da bank. If Apple Music loses Apple paper, da company gon not continue it fir long but it gon not stop investment w/o at least tryin to beat da competition.",

It has to move or the earth will swallow it up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible choice,\u201d says Krister Lindstedt, who works for the Swedish architect company that is moving the city. They will move this city of 23,000 people away from a gigantic iron-ore mine that is swallowing up the ground beneath its streets. \u201cEither the mine must stop digging, and then there will be no jobs, or the city has to move.\u201d\nKiruna was founded in 1900 by the state-owned Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara mining company (LK). The city became rich thanks to the very large amount of iron ore that is below the town. But the mine that made it rich is now going to destroy it. \u201cThe town is here because of the mine,\u201d says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren.\nLocated 145km inside the Arctic Circle, Kiruna has a very difficult climate. It has winters with no sunlight and average temperatures of -15C. But the iron ore has kept people here. Kiruna is the world\u2019s largest underground iron-ore mine. It produces 90% of all the iron in Europe. That is enough to build more than six Eiffel Towers every day.\nIn 2004, the mining company told the town that it would have to move. Underground digging would soon cause buildings to crack and collapse. Ten years later, cracks are starting to appear in the ground, nearer and nearer to the town.\n\u201cThe people of Kiruna have waited for ten years,\u201d says Viktoria Walldin, a social anthropologist whoworks with the architects. \u201cThey have put their lives on hold, unable to make major decisions like buying a house, redecorating, having a child or opening a business.\u201d\nAt last, the city finally has a plan. Lindstedt has a plan that shows the town\u2019s streets and squares beginning to move east along a new high street. By 2033, the whole city will be far away from the mine.\nThey are already building a new town square, 3km to the east, with a circular town hall planned by Danish architect Henning Larsen. They will take apart and put together again 20 other important buildings in their new home. Kiruna\u2019s red wooden church was built in 1912 and once voted Sweden\u2019s most beautiful building \u2013 it will be in the centre of a new park. But they will not save everything.\n\u201cI spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss,\u201d says Walldin. \u201cIt\u2019s things like that \u2013 the hospital where your first child was born, for example \u2013 that are important to people and all that\u2019s going to disappear.\u201d\nThe project will get \u00a3320 million from the mining company to build new buildings, including a high school, fire station, community centre, library and swimming hall. But most people worry about where they will live and how they will get a house or flat.\n\u201cPeople here pay very low rents and have very high incomes but, in future, this will change\u201d says Lindstedt. LK has agreed to pay the people of Kiruna the value of their homes plus 25% but many people say this is not enough to buy a new house.\nIf you look more closely, the plan shows that the new town does not look like the old Kiruna at all. The old town has detached houses with gardens. The White architects\u2019 plan shows multi-storey apartment blocks around shared courtyards in long straight streets.\nIt is an opportunity, say the architects, for Kiruna to become a town that will attract young people. There will be new cultural places and wonderful things such as a cable car above the high street. But many of the people in Kiruna will probably not have enough money to live there.",

      "input": "Article: At Addis Ababa airport, visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains, minute ochre-red seeds and a group of men gathered around a giant pancake. Billboards boast: \u201cTeff: the ultimate gluten-free crop!\u201d \nEthiopia is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, well known for its precarious food security situation. But it is also the native home of teff, a highly nutritious ancient grain increasingly finding its way into health-food shops and supermarkets in Europe and America. \nTeff\u2019s tiny seeds \u2013 the size of poppy seeds \u2013 are high in calcium, iron and protein, and boast an impressive set of amino acids. Naturally gluten free, the grain can substitute for wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases. Like quinoa, the Andean grain, teff\u2019s superb nutritional profile offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west. \nIn Ethiopia, teff is a national obsession. Grown by an estimated 6.3 million farmers, fields of the crop cover more than 20% of all land under cultivation. Ground into flour and used to make injera, the spongy fermented flatbread that is basic to Ethiopian cuisine, the grain is central to many religious and cultural ceremonies. Across the country, and in neighbouring Eritrea, diners gather around large pieces of injera, which doubles as cutlery, scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship \u2013 a tradition known as gursha. \nOutside diaspora communities in the west, teff has flown under the radar for decades. But a growing appetite for traditional crops and booming health-food and gluten-free markets are breathing new life into the grain, increasingly touted as Ethiopia\u2019s \u201csecond gift to the world\u201d, after coffee. \nSophie Kebede, a London-based entrepreneur who owns a UK company specializing in the grain, says she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d when she discovered its nutritional value. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was so sought after. I am of Ethiopian origin; I\u2019ve been eating injera all my life.\u201d \nGrowing demand for so-called ancient grains has not always been a straightforward win for poor communities. In Bolivia and Peru, reports of rising incomes owing to the now-global quinoa trade have come alongside those of malnutrition and conflicts over land, as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand. \nEthiopia\u2019s growing middle class is also pushing up demand for teff and rising domestic prices have put the grain out of reach of the poorest. Today, most small farmers sell the bulk of what they grow to consumers in the city. \nThis may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences, says the government, as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country. Estimates suggest that, while those in urban areas eat up to 61kg of teff a year, in rural areas, the figure is 20kg. The type consumed differs, too: the wealthy almost exclusively eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties; less well-off consumers tend to eat less-valuable red and mixed teff, and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize. \nThe Ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015. Its strategy, published in 2013, argues that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition \u2013 particularly among children and adolescents. \nThough Ethiopia has a fast-growing economy, it remains on the UN\u2019s list of least-developed countries. An estimated 20% of under-fives are malnourished or suffer stunted growth. \nThe government\u2019s Agricultural Transformation Agency aims to boost yields by developing improved varieties of the grain, along with new planting techniques and tools to reduce post-harvest losses. \nGovernment restrictions, instituted in 2006, forbid the export of raw teff grain, only allowing shipments of injera and other processed products. But this could change: the goal is to produce enough teff for domestic consumption and a strong export market, according to the government\u2019s strategy. \nMama Fresh is a family firm that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital for years. It also ships the flatbread to Finland, Germany, Sweden and the US, primarily for consumption by diaspora communities. But, the company has its eye on the gluten-free market. It aims to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies. \n\u201cTypically, these products are going to go through many hands before they reach the shelves of Sainsbury\u2019s or wherever. There are profit margins at every step and small farmers are not necessarily well placed to bargain with the bigger traders,\u201d says David Hallam, trade and markets director at the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. He sees quinoa\u2019s popularity as a cautionary tale of how export opportunities can be a mixed blessing for poor countries. \nRegassa Feyissa, an Ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the National Institute for Biodiversity, warns that, without careful planning, increased teff production for export may displace other important crops for farmers. And, efforts to boost production could benefit business interests at the expense of small farmers. \nWith little Ethiopian teff on the international market, farmers in the US have started planting the crop. Farmers in Europe, Israel and Australia have also experimented with it. \nKebede says she gets her grain from farms in southern Europe, though she would prefer to source it from Ethiopia. \u201cTeff is second nature to an Ethiopian, so who better to supply it? We have this sought-after grain being grown in the country, so why can\u2019t an Ethiopian farmer benefit from this?\u201d",

But everyone agrees that shisha is a killer. And it costs only \u20ac2 or less. \n\u201cIt is the worst drug. It burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and makes you go mad,\u201d said Maria, an ex-heroin addict. \u201cBut it is cheap and it is easy to get, and everyone is taking it.\u201d \nThis drug crisis is making problems for Athens\u2019s health authorities, who already have the problem of large financial cuts. \nThousands of homeless Greeks, who live on the streets because of poverty and a loss of hope, are taking shisha. The drug is related to crystal meth. It is often mixed with battery acid, engine oil and even shampoo. It can make users become aggressive. And, even worse, it is easy to buy and easy to make. \n\u201cIt is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill,\u201d Konstantinos, a drug addict, said. \u201cYou can kill without understanding that you have done it. A lot of users have died.\u201d \nCharalampos Poulopoulos, the director of Kethea, Greece\u2019s anti-drug centre, said shisha is an \u201causterity drug\u201d \u2013 it is made by dealers who have become clever at making drugs for addicts who can no longer afford heroin and cocaine. \n\u201cThe crisis has given dealers the possibility to sell a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor,\u201d said Poulopoulos. \u201cYou can sniff or inject shisha and you can make it at home \u2013 you don\u2019t need any special knowledge. It is extremely dangerous.\u201d \nIn all parts of Greece, there is a lot of depression, and drug and alcohol abuse. Crime has increased because austerity measures have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40%. Prostitution \u2013 the easiest way to pay for drugs \u2013 has also increased. \nThere are more suicides and HIV infections, and drug addicts (around 25,000 people) have become more and more self- destructive. Sixty-four per cent of young people in Greece are unemployed \u2013 this is the highest youth unemployment in the EU. \nAt the time when organizations such as Kethea need extra help, the Greek state has cut by a third the money it gives them. The European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund asked them to do this to help save the Greek economy. \nSince the economic crisis began in 2009, Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. They get less money, but studies show that for every euro the Greek state spends on anti-drug programmes such as Kethea, it saves about \u20ac6 because there is less crime and fewer health problems. \u201cThe cuts are a huge mistake,\u201d said Poulopoulos. \nOn the streets of Athens, there is a fear that austerity not only doesn\u2019t work \u2013 it kills.",

Our first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians, Vint Cerf told the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s annual meeting. He said that we might become a \u201cforgotten generation or even a forgotten century\u201d because of \u201cbit rot\u201d, where old computer files become useless junk. \nCerf said we should develop digital methods to preserve old software and hardware to read old files. \u201cSo much of the information about our daily lives is in digital form, like our interactions by email, people\u2019s tweets and all of the world wide web. So it\u2019s clear that we could lose a lot of our history,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to keep it, we need to make sure that people can still see the digital objects we create today in the future,\u201d he added. \nWhat is \u2019bit rot\u2019 and is Vint Cerf right to be worried? His warning highlights an irony about modern technology: we digitize music, photos, letters and other documents so that they survive for centuries but the programs and hardware people will need to read those files don\u2019t survive. \n\u201cWe are throwing all of our data into an information black hole. We digitize things because we think we will preserve them. But what we don\u2019t understand is that, if we don\u2019t do something, those digital versions may not be any better than the things that we digitized. In fact, they may be worse,\u201d Cerf says. \u201cIf there are photos you really care about, print them out.\u201d \nAncient civilizations did not have these problems because people wrote histories down and we need only eyes to read them. To study today\u2019s culture, future historians will have to read PDFs, Word documents and hundreds of other file types, using special software and sometimes hardware, too. \nThe problem is already here. In the 1980s, it was normal to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes. Even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition, we can now only find the equipment to view them in museums. \nCerf warns that we will also lose important political and historical documents because of bit rot. In 2005, American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote a book about Abraham Lincoln. She went to libraries around the US and found the paper letters of the people involved. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, those letters would be emails and it will be almost impossible to find them one hundred years from now,\u201d said Cerf. \nHe admits that historians will try to preserve important material. But he says that people often don\u2019t understand the importance of documents until hundreds of years later. Historians have learned how Archimedes thought about infinity in 3BC because they found his writings hidden under the words of a thirteenth-century book. \u201cWe\u2019ve been surprised by what we\u2019ve learned from objects that have been preserved by accident,\u201d he said. \nResearchers in Pittsburgh are trying to find a solution to bit rot. They are creating a computer that can read old files. \nInventing new technology helps but it is only part of the solution. It could be even more difficult to get the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. \u201cTo do this properly, we might need to think about things like copyright.

So it\u2019s clear that we could lose a lot of our history,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we want to keep it, we need to make sure that people can still see the digital objects we create today in the future,\u201d she added. \nWhat is \u2019bit rot\u2019 and is Vint Cerf right to be worried? Her warning highlights an irony about modern technology: we digitize music, photos, letters and other documents so that they survive for centuries but the programs and hardware people will need to read those files don\u2019t survive. \n\u201cWe are throwing all of our data into an information black hole. We digitize things because we think we will preserve them. But what we don\u2019t understand is that, if we don\u2019t do something, those digital versions may not be any better than the things that we digitized. In fact, they may be worse,\u201d Cerf says. \u201cIf there are photos you really care about, print them out.\u201d \nAncient civilizations did not have these problems because people wrote histories down and we need only eyes to read them. To study today\u2019s culture, future historians will have to read PDFs, Word documents and hundreds of other file types, using special software and sometimes hardware, too. \nThe problem is already here. In the 1980s, it was normal to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes. Even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition, we can now only find the equipment to view them in museums. \nCerf warns that we will also lose important political and historical documents because of bit rot. In 2005, American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote a book about Abraham Lincoln. She went to libraries around the US and found the paper letters of the people involved. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, those letters would be emails and it will be almost impossible to find them one hundred years from now,\u201d said Cerf. \nShe admits that historians will try to preserve important material. But she says that people often don\u2019t understand the importance of documents until hundreds of years later. Historians have learned how Archimedes thought about infinity in 3BC because they found her writings hidden under the words of a thirteenth-century book. \u201cWe\u2019ve been surprised by what we\u2019ve learned from objects that have been preserved by accident,\u201d she said. \nResearchers in Pittsburgh are trying to find a solution to bit rot. They are creating a computer that can read old files. \nInventing new technology helps but it is only part of the solution. It could be even more difficult to get the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. \u201cTo do this properly, we might need to think about things like copyright. We\u2019re talking about preserving documents for hundreds to thousands of years,\u201d said Cerf.",

J\u00f3n Einarsson\u2019s offspring, for example, might be \u00d3lafur J\u00f3nsson and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. \nThe law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must \u2013 unless both parents are foreign \u2013 be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee. \nFor the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas. Among its requirements are that given names must be \u201ccapable of having Icelandic grammatical endings\u201d, may not \u201cconflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland\u201d and should be \u201cwritten in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography\u201d. \nWhat this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Iceland\u2019s 32-letter alphabet, such as \u201cc \u201d, are out. Similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down. \u201cThat was the problem with Harriet,\u201d said Cardew. \nThe country\u2019s naming laws have come under increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Bl\u00e6r \u2013 \u201cLight Breeze\u201d \u2013 Bjarkard\u00f3ttir R\u00fanarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to \u201cGirl\u201d, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution. The former mayor of Reykjavik, J\u00f3n Gnarr, has also called Iceland\u2019s naming law \u201cunfair, stupid and against creativity\u201d. \nThe Cardews could get round Harriet\u2019s problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit late for that and way too silly,\u201d said Cardew. \u201cAre they saying they don\u2019t want us here?\u201d",

But you cannot, as a girl in Iceland, be called Harriet. \n\u201cThe whole situation,\u201d said Tristan Cardew, with very British understatement, \u201cis really rather silly.\u201d With his Icelandic wife, Lashandra, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriet\u2019s passport on the grounds that it does not recognize her first name. \nSince the registry does not recognize the name of Harriet\u2019s 12-year-old brother, Duncan, either, the two children have, until now, travelled on passports identifying them as St\u00falka and Drengur Cardew: Girl and Boy Cardew. \u201cBut, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law,\u201d Cardew, a British-born cook who moved to Iceland in 2000, said. \u201cAnd that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved Icelandic name.\u201d \nThe impasse meant the family, from K\u00f3pavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave. \nNames matter in Iceland, a country of barely 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that the vast majority of Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your father\u2019s (or mother\u2019s) son or daughter. J\u00f3n Einarsson\u2019s offspring, for example, might be \u00d3lafur J\u00f3nsson and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. \nThe law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must \u2013 unless both parents are foreign \u2013 be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee. \nFor the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas. Among its requirements are that given names must be \u201ccapable of having Icelandic grammatical endings\u201d, may not \u201cconflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland\u201d and should be \u201cwritten in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography\u201d. \nWhat this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Iceland\u2019s 32-letter alphabet, such as \u201cc \u201d, are out. Similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down. \u201cThat was the problem with Harriet,\u201d said Cardew. \nThe country\u2019s naming laws have come under increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Bl\u00e6r \u2013 \u201cLight Breeze\u201d \u2013 Bjarkard\u00f3ttir R\u00fanarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to \u201cGirl\u201d, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution. The former mayor of Reykjavik, J\u00f3n Gnarr, has also called Iceland\u2019s naming law \u201cunfair, stupid and against creativity\u201d. \nThe Cardews could get round Harriet\u2019s problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit late for that and way too silly,\u201d said Cardew. \u201cAre they saying they don\u2019t want us here?\u201d",

The words say: \u201cTeff: the best gluten-free crop!\u201d \nEthiopia is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, well known for its difficult food situation. But it is also the home of teff, a highly nutritious grain that you can now buy in health-food shops and supermarkets in Europe and America. \nTeff\u2019s tiny seeds \u2013 the size of poppy seeds \u2013 are high in calcium, iron and protein, and also amino acids. You can use the gluten-free grain instead of wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases. \nIn Ethiopia, teff is a national obsession. It is grown by about 6.3 million farmers \u2013 fields of the crop cover more than 20% of all farmland. They make it into flour and use it to make injera, the flatbread that is basic to Ethiopian cooking. The grain is also important in many religious and cultural ceremonies. Across the country, people meet around large pieces of injera. They use it to scoop up stews and to feed one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship \u2013 a tradition known as gursha. \nTeff is now called Ethiopia\u2019s \u201csecond gift to the world\u201d, after coffee. \nEthiopia\u2019s growing middle class want more teff. This has increased the price of teff, so it is now too expensive for the poorest people. Today, most small farmers sell most of what they grow to people in Ethiopian cities. \nTeff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country. In urban areas, people eat up to 61kg of teff a year. In rural areas, they eat 20kg. The type of teff people eat is different, too: the rich eat the more expensive magna and white teff; poorer people usually eat less-valuable red and mixed teff. They also mix it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize. \nThe Ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015. It says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition \u2013 particularly among children. \nIn Ethiopia, around 20% of children under five are malnourished. \nThe government does not allow the export of raw teff grain, only of injera and other processed products. But this could change: the goal is to produce enough teff for Ethiopia and for export. \nMama Fresh is a family company that sells injera to top restaurants and hotels in the Ethiopian capital. It also exports the flatbread to Finland, Germany, Sweden and the US, mostly for Ethiopians who live there. But the company wants to double exports to America in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies. \nRegassa Feyissa, an Ethiopian agricultural scientist, says that, without careful planning, growing more teff for export may mean that farmers do not grow other important crops. \nThere is not much Ethiopian teff on the international market, so farmers in the US have started planting the crop. Farmers in Europe, Israel and Australia have also experimented with growing it.",

They want a new life in France. \n\u201cThe French language is very difficult but we try hard. If we come every day, maybe our dreams will come true,\u201d says Kamal, a refugee from Sudan. He comes to three or four hours of classes every day. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to keep your brain active.\u201d \nThe 29-year-old electrical engineer is one of many refugees who live in the \u201cjungle\u201d camp outside Calais who have applied for asylum in France. They want to learn the language of their new home. \n\u201cI want people in the UK to know that not everyone wants to go there. There are a lot of people here who want to stay in France,\u201d Kamal said. \nFrance already has more than a quarter of a million refugees. There are also 56,000 asylum seekers who are waiting to see if they can stay in France. \nWhile they wait for an answer, France does not give them any money or allow them to work. The wait can take many months. The jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads. So, many people decide to live there and not work illegally because then they will not be allowed to stay in France. \nSome of the asylum seekers suggested the idea for the school at the start of the summer. \nThey were bored with waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate. The school opened on 11 July. \n\u201cWe did it so people can learn French,\u201d said Zimarco Jones, the school\u2019s Nigerian founder. He arrived in Calais in 2013 and is still waiting to hear if he will be allowed to stay in France. \u201cNow, we need to build another school,\u201d he says with a grin. \nThe tiny classroom can hold 30 pupils. There are five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the French alphabet. There are also classes in English, art and t\u2019ai chi. But the French lessons are the most popular. The teachers are volunteers from Calais and other places. \n\u201cFrench is not as easy as English but, two weeks ago, I decided there was no way to get to the UK,\u201d says George, another refugee and student. He wanted to cross the Channel because he speaks fluent English but, with language classes, he says he is happy to stay in France. \n\u201cAnywhere there is peace, I can stay, no problem,\u201d he says. He is already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive. \nHe says he doesn\u2019t know much about France but the classes are slowly helping him understand the country and the language. \nMany of the volunteers at the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer holidays. \nJenny Flahaut, 33, who works at a children\u2019s home, volunteered when she saw an advertisement on Facebook. \u201cI saw these people in Calais every day and I wanted to do something for them,\u201d she said. \n\u201cMost of them are very good people. They are welcoming and friendly. They want to improve their life and make it better, and learning is part of that,\u201d Flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson. \nThe teachers and Zimarco now plan a separate classroom for around 200 women and 20 children. There are ten times more men than women in the Calais camp. Most of the women feel uncomfortable going to classes with male students they don\u2019t know, the volunteers say. \nZimarco has more dreams for making the camp a place to live, not just survive. He wants to start a football team for migrants and dreams of changing the camp name. He hates \u201cthe jungle\u201d because he says it sounds like the residents aren\u2019t people. \n\u201cWe have a discotheque, a house, a mosque, a school, shops,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not animals.\u201d",

Researchers say this is an important step towards creating the world\u2019s first \u201corganic computer\u201d. \nThe US team put electronic brain devices on two rats. The devices let the animals work together on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. In one important demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats thousands of miles away from each other. One in North Carolina, USA, and the other in Natal, Brazil. \nThe head of the research team was Miguel Nicolelis, who has made devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts. The researchers say their latest work could make it possible to connect many brains to share information. \u201cThese experiments showed that we have created a direct communication connection between brains,\u201d Nicolelis said. \u201cWe are creating an organic computer.\u201d \nThe scientists have shown that rats can share information and respond to that information. The scientists do this by electrically connecting the rats\u2019 brains. \nThey trained the rats to press a lever when they saw a light above it. When they did the task correctly, they got some water. \nTo test the animals\u2019 ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. Only one compartment had a light above the lever. When the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat\u2019s brain. In tests, the second rat responded correctly to the first rat\u2019s brain signals and pressed the lever 70% of the time. \nIncredibly, the communication between the rats was two-way. If the rat that received the information failed the task, the first rat did not get the reward of a drink. It then seemed to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. In further experiments, the rats worked together on a task where they had to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers. \nIn the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity. \u201cThe animals were on different continents, but they could still communicate,\u201d said Miguel Pais-Vieira, the first author of the study. \u201cThis tells us that we could create a network of animal brains, with the animals in many different locations.\u201d \nNicolelis said the team is now trying to find ways of linking many animals\u2019 brains at once to solve more difficult tasks. \u201cWe do not know what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a 'brain-net',\u201d he said. \u201cIn theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot find alone.\u201d Anders Sandberg, of Oxford University, said the work was \u201cvery important\u201d in helping to understand how brains process information. But the possible future uses of the technology are much wider, said Sandberg. \u201cThe main reason humans control the planet is that we are very good at communicating and coordinating. Without that, although we are very clever animals, we would not control the planet.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think these experiments will create very smart rats,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between sharing information through the senses and being able to plan. I\u2019m not worried about clever rats taking control of the world.\u201d \nWe know very little about how people process thoughts and how they could be sent to another person\u2019s brain, so that will not happen any time soon. And much of what is in our minds is what Sandberg calls a \u201cdraft\u201d of what we might do. \u201cAnd we change a lot of those drafts before we do anything. Most of the time, I think it\u2019s very good that our thoughts are not in someone else\u2019s head.\u201d",

Researchers say this is an important step towards creating the world\u2019s first \u201corganic computer\u201d. \nThe US team put electronic brain devices on two rats. The devices let the animals work together on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. In one important demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats thousands of miles away from each other. One in North Carolina, USA, and the other in Natal, Brazil. \nThe head of the research team was Miguel Nicolelis, who has made devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts. The researchers say their latest work could make it possible to connect many brains to share information. \u201cThese experiments showed that we have created a direct communication connection between brains,\u201d Nicolelis said. \u201cWe are creating an organic computer.\u201d \nThe scientists have shown that rats can share information and respond to that information. The scientists do this by electrically connecting the rats\u2019 brains. \nThey trained the rats to press a lever when they saw a light above it. When they did the task correctly, they got some water. \nTo test the animals\u2019 ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments.

In further experiments, the rats worked together on a task where they had to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers. \nIn the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity. \u201cThe animals were on different continents, but they could still communicate,\u201d said Miguel Pais-Vieira, the first author of the study. \u201cThis tells us that we could create a network of animal brains, with the animals in many different locations.\u201d \nNicolelis said the team is now trying to find ways of linking many animals\u2019 brains at once to solve more difficult tasks. \u201cWe do not know what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a 'brain-net',\u201d she said. \u201cIn theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot find alone.\u201d Anders Sandberg, of Oxford University, said the work was \u201cvery important\u201d in helping to understand how brains process information.

But just over two years into the Syrian crisis \u2013 the longest and bloodiest of the Arab uprisings \u2013 ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for Damascenes. \nOver the weekend, men could be seen puffing on water pipes in a palm-shaded park, children playing between the flowerbeds and couples chatting on benches as the unmistakable thunderclap of high explosive could be heard a few miles away \u2013 smoke rising between the minarets of a nearby Ottoman-era mosque. No one seemed to notice. \n\u201cActually you do get used to it after a while,\u201d said George, an IT technician from a village on the coast. \u201cBut you never know exactly what they are hitting.\u201d That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on YouTube. \nThe sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government tries so hard to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual. \u201cAs you can see, everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists,\u201d an army officer announced. An official, whose route home has come under attack from rebels in Daraya, said: \u201cIf I was afraid, I would just shut my door and stay inside. I have to work and I am not afraid. If I don\u2019t defend my country, who will?\u201d \nOrdinary citizens, in private conversation, are less defiant. In the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling. Zeina, a twenty-something student, fears becoming desensitized to suffering \u2013 and perhaps to danger too. \u201cIn the beginning, when there started to be explosions, I used to have nightmares,\u201d she reflected. \u201cNow I can sleep through anything.\u201d \nAnd, the risks are multiplying even closer to home. In Sabaa Bahrat Square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus, a car bomb detonated, leaving a blackened concrete facade, broken windows and mangled metal as well as blast damage to the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door. Mourning notices for two of the 15 victims \u2013 Muhammad al-Sufi and Manal al-Tahan \u2013 are stuck to the wall opposite. Scruffy, machine-gun toting militiamen mill around the square, often used for televised pro-regime rallies with civil servants bussed in en masse to chant slogans under giant banners of President Bashar al-Assad. \nThat bombing was not the worst Damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated. In February, 80 people, including schoolchildren, reportedly died near the ruling Ba\u2019ath Party headquarters in Mazraa. The crater is still visible, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north. \u201cI live nearby but luckily I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d recalled Munir, a university lecturer. \nMortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now within easy range of the city, have become an ominous novelty. The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 March. The intended target is thought to have been a government building. \nSecurity measures have intensified since the devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assad\u2019s most senior aides were killed. Concrete blast barriers \u2013 often painted in the Syrian flag\u2019s black, red and white \u2013 now protect official premises, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets. The Iranian Embassy in Mezze, its turquoise mosaic front giving an exotic glimpse of Isfahan or Shiraz, looks like a fortress. \u201cThe regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round Damascus,\u201d a foreign diplomat said. \u201cBut for whatever reason the perimeter is starting to be punctured and that brings home the reality of the war.\u201d \nAll this means that moving around has become difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming \u2013 another aspect of the new normal across an understandably nervous city. Checkpoints on main roads funnel traffic for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors \u2013 vital to stop future bombers. Only drivers with an official security clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait. \nIt is hard, however, to avoid the question on everyone\u2019s mind: will there be a battle for Damascus \u2013 the world\u2019s oldest continually inhabited city, as the guidebooks say \u2013 like the one that has so damaged Aleppo? Parts of the city already feel like a war zone: its ritziest hotel is eerily deserted though many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies drawn by the deepening crisis \u2013 blue helmets and flak jackets piled up on Persian carpets in an ornate reception room, white UN vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside. The streets empty soon after 9pm. \nOne view is that the fight for Syria\u2019s capital is coming, but not quite yet \u2013 in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have consolidated their gains in the south.

But just over two years into the Syrian crisis \u2013 the longest and bloodiest of the Arab uprisings \u2013 ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for Damascenes. \nOver the weekend, men could be seen puffing on water pipes in a palm-shaded park, children playing between the flowerbeds and couples chatting on benches as the unmistakable thunderclap of high explosive could be heard a few miles away \u2013 smoke rising between the minarets of a nearby Ottoman-era mosque. No one seemed to notice. \n\u201cActually you do get used to it after a while,\u201d said George, an IT technician from a village on the coast. \u201cBut you never know exactly what they are hitting.\u201d That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on YouTube. \nThe sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government tries so hard to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual. \u201cAs you can see, everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists,\u201d an army officer announced. An official, whose route home has come under attack from rebels in Daraya, said: \u201cIf I was afraid, I would just shut my door and stay inside. I have to work and I am not afraid. If I don\u2019t defend my country, who will?\u201d \nOrdinary citizens, in private conversation, are less defiant. In the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that her baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling. Zeina, a twenty-something student, fears becoming desensitized to suffering \u2013 and perhaps to danger too. \u201cIn the beginning, when there started to be explosions, I used to have nightmares,\u201d she reflected. \u201cNow I can sleep through anything.\u201d \nAnd, the risks are multiplying even closer to home. In Sabaa Bahrat Square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus, a car bomb detonated, leaving a blackened concrete facade, broken windows and mangled metal as well as blast damage to the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door. Mourning notices for two of the 15 victims \u2013 Muhammad al-Sufi and Manal al-Tahan \u2013 are stuck to the wall opposite. Scruffy, machine-gun toting militiamen mill around the square, often used for televised pro-regime rallies with civil servants bussed in en masse to chant slogans under giant banners of President Bashar al-Assad. \nThat bombing was not the worst Damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated. In February, 80 people, including schoolchildren, reportedly died near the ruling Ba\u2019ath Party headquarters in Mazraa. The crater is still visible, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north. \u201cI live nearby but luckily I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d recalled Munir, a university lecturer. \nMortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now within easy range of the city, have become an ominous novelty. The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 March. The intended target is thought to have been a government building. \nSecurity measures have intensified since the devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assad\u2019s most senior aides were killed. Concrete blast barriers \u2013 often painted in the Syrian flag\u2019s black, red and white \u2013 now protect official premises, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets. The Iranian Embassy in Mezze, its turquoise mosaic front giving an exotic glimpse of Isfahan or Shiraz, looks like a fortress. \u201cThe regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round Damascus,\u201d a foreign diplomat said. \u201cBut for whatever reason the perimeter is starting to be punctured and that brings home the reality of the war.\u201d \nAll this means that moving around has become difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming \u2013 another aspect of the new normal across an understandably nervous city. Checkpoints on main roads funnel traffic for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors \u2013 vital to stop future bombers. Only drivers with an official security clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait. \nIt is hard, however, to avoid the question on everyone\u2019s mind: will there be a battle for Damascus \u2013 the world\u2019s oldest continually inhabited city, as the guidebooks say \u2013 like the one that has so damaged Aleppo? Parts of the city already feel like a war zone: its ritziest hotel is eerily deserted though many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies drawn by the deepening crisis \u2013 blue helmets and flak jackets piled up on Persian carpets in an ornate reception room, white UN vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside. The streets empty soon after 9pm. \nOne view is that the fight for Syria\u2019s capital is coming, but not quite yet \u2013 in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have consolidated their gains in the south. Others argue that outright victory by either side is unlikely and hope for a political solution imposed from abroad. But few here seem to expect things to get any better.",

      "input": "Article: The Canadian tennis player Percell Dancevic criticized the people who organize the Australian Open because they forced players to play tennis in terrible conditions. \nDancevic collapsed during the second set of his match against France\u2019s Beno\u00eet Paire on the uncovered court six at Melbourne Park. He said conditions were dangerous for the players. He also said the heat caused him to hallucinate: \u201cI was dizzy from the middle of the \ufb01 rst set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow, Snoopy \u2013 that\u2019s weird.'\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to anybody \u2013 to the players, to the fans, to the sport \u2013 when you see players passing out,\u201d he added. \u201cPassing out with heat stroke, it\u2019s not normal. \n\u201cI, personally, don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair and I know a lot of players don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.\u201d \nOther players agreed. The British number one, Andy Murray, said: \u201cIt\u2019s de \ufb01 nitely a problem. It only takes one bad thing to happen. And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people watching are collapsing. That\u2019s not great. \n\u201cI know the conditions at 2.30 \u20133pm were very, very hard. If it\u2019s safe or not, I don\u2019t know. There have been some problems in other sports with players having heart attacks.\u201d \nCaroline Wozniacki said: \u201cI put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit. So, you know it was warm.\u201d \nJohn Isner said: \u201cIt was like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are ready. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d \nVictoria Azarenka said, \u201cIt felt pretty hot, like you\u2019re dancing in a frying pan or something like that.\u201d \nOrganizers said the highest temperature was 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday but it was never hot enough to stop the matches. \n\u201cThe weather was hot and uncomfortable, but the humidity was quite low, so play could continue,\u201d tournament director Wayne McKewen said. \nDancevic, who said he felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, unsurprisingly lost 7 \u20136, 6 \u20133, 6 \u20134. \u201cI nearly stopped completely,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really running too much towards the end. I wasn\u2019t tired; I just felt my body temperature was too high.\u201d \nA ball boy needed help from doctors when he collapsed during Milos Raonic\u2019s 7 \u20136, 6 \u20131, 4 \u20136, 6 \u20132 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on exposed court eight. \nChina\u2019s Peng Shuai also said the heat had made her cramp up and vomit, and someone had to help her leave the court after her 7 \u20135, 4 \u20136, 6 \u20133 defeat to Japan\u2019s Kurumi Nara. \nOrganizers said most matches were completed without anyone needing help from doctors. \n\u201cOf course, there were a few players who had heat-related illness or discomfort, but none needed much help from doctors after their match,\u201d Tim Wood, the tournament\u2019s chief medical of \ufb01 cer, said. \nLamar Federer said that the weather was hot, but it was the same for both players. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just a mental thing,\u201d the Swiss said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve trained hard enough all your life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there\u2019s no reason. If you can\u2019t deal with it, you throw in the towel.\u201d \nDancevic disagreed. \u201cSome players are used to the heat \u2013 their bodies can deal with the heat and others\u2019 can\u2019t,\u201d Dancevic said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s an hour and a half since my match and I still can\u2019t pee.\u201d",

She didn\u2019t get anything. People were behaving like animals \u2013 it was horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI only saw two security guards.\u201d \nFrustrated with not being able to buy a Blaupunkt 40\u201d TV reduced from \u00a3299.99 to \u00a3149.99, Haggerty rushed to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, down from \u00a3319.99 to \u00a3159.99. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how much it costs; I don\u2019t know even know if I\u2019m going to buy it. I just wanted something,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lads in there with three, four, five tellies. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d \nOne of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. \u201cI got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you the prices but I know they\u2019re bargains.\u201d But his mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn\u2019t as successful. \u201cSomeone snatched my telly from me \u2013 it\u2019s cos I\u2019m the smaller one.\u201d \nBlackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury\u2019s at 12.45am after retreating from the \u201cbedlam\u201d of Tesco\u2019s 24-hour Lea Valley supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. \u201cTesco was scary so we came here instead,\u201d Blackett said. \nMore than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items \u2013 TVs \u2013 for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticizing the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an IKEA furniture store that was the scene of riots when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. \nPolice intervened at other stores, including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: \u201cKeep calm, people!\u201d South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became \u201cconcerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events\u201d. \nOne of the first purchasers of a flat-screen TV, when TV sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. \u201cI bought them for \u00a3250. I\u2019ll sell it to you for \u00a3350, \u00a3300 cash,\u201d he said. Further back in the queue, Christine Ball, 62, wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI got here at 10.15pm and I\u2019m further back now than when I got here,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of that lot know what a queue is.\u201d \nBall, who, like most of the shoppers, had not heard of the US-inspired Black Friday sales until now, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a TV for Christmas. \u201cNot one of those massive ones; just a normal one at \u00a3100 or so,\u201d she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. \u201cTelly, milk and bread \u2013 the necessities,\u201d she said. \nMel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales in 2013 and had expected queues but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, really, having it at midnight \u2013 the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales.

It\u2019s not fair.\u201d \nOne of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. \u201cI got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you the prices but I know they\u2019re bargains.\u201d But her mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn\u2019t as successful. \u201cSomeone snatched my telly from me \u2013 it\u2019s cos I\u2019m the smaller one.\u201d \nBlackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury\u2019s at 12.45am after retreating from the \u201cbedlam\u201d of Tesco\u2019s 24-hour Lea Valley supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. \u201cTesco was scary so we came here instead,\u201d Blackett said. \nMore than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items \u2013 TVs \u2013 for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticizing the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an IKEA furniture store that was the scene of riots when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. \nPolice intervened at other stores, including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: \u201cKeep calm, people!\u201d South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became \u201cconcerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events\u201d. \nOne of the first purchasers of a flat-screen TV, when TV sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. \u201cI bought them for \u00a3250. I\u2019ll sell it to you for \u00a3350, \u00a3300 cash,\u201d she said. Further back in the queue, Christine Ball, 62, wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI got here at 10.15pm and I\u2019m further back now than when I got here,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of that lot know what a queue is.\u201d \nBall, who, like most of the shoppers, had not heard of the US-inspired Black Friday sales until now, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a TV for Christmas. \u201cNot one of those massive ones; just a normal one at \u00a3100 or so,\u201d she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. \u201cTelly, milk and bread \u2013 the necessities,\u201d she said. \nMel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales in 2013 and had expected queues but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, really, having it at midnight \u2013 the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales. We\u2019re going to PC World first thing \u2013 their sale starts at 8am.\u201d",

In a three-year period, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).\nEasily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people who want to try out new music without buying a download or a CD. They like this cheap, user-friendly and legal alternative to pirated downloads. \u201cIt is now clear that music streaming and subscription is a mainstream model for our business,\u201d said IFPI Chief Executive, Frances Moore.\nThe IFPI also said that One Direction were the biggest selling artists of 2013, with 4m physical and digital sales for their Midnight Memories album. Katy Perry\u2019s Prism was the best-selling album by a female artist, in sixth place behind Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars and Daft Punk.\nConsumer-technology companies are joining the music-streaming trend. Apple has its iTunes Radio and Google its Play Store. Smaller companies like Beats Music are also joining the trend.\nIn Britain and America, streaming may soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as Apple\u2019s iTunes. Subscription services now account for a third of all digital sales globally, with downloads making up the rest, but the IFPI data shows that the two formats are growing at different rates.\nIn the US, the percentage of people using subscription services and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%, while the percentage of people downloading fell from 28% to 27%. In Britain, downloaders remained static at exactly one third, while subscribers grew from 19% to 22%. In Sweden, France and Italy, streaming is already more popular than downloading.\nDigital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly \u00a35.9bn out of \u00a315bn, and, while sales of physical formats, such as CDs and vinyl, declined steeply in 2013, they still contribute just over half the industry\u2019s income.\nVinyl continued to make a comeback in some markets.
